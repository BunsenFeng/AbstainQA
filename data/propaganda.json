During the arraignment hearing, Magistrate Judge Kirtan Khalsa told the defendants there was \u201cclear and convincing evidence that you are a danger to the community,\u201d The Associated Press reported. A federal grand jury indicted the group on Tuesday on conspiracy and federal firearms charges stemming from the discovery of a cache of weapons after law enforcement raided their home in search of a missing boy but, instead, found 11 malnourished children living in squalid conditions. Federal prosecutors say that between Dec. 2017 and August 2018, the group, who are either siblings or related by marriage, had \u201ca common plan to prepare for violent attacks on government, military, educational and financial institutions.\u201d U.S. Attorney John C. Anderson and Special Agent in Charge James C. Langenberg of the FBI\u2019s Albuquerque Division, said in a statement that the defendants\u2019 home in Amalia, N.M., served as a firing range and training camp to carry out an attack as part of a religious prophecy. According to the indictment, some of the minors were being prepared \u201cto engage in jihad and \u2026 to die as martyrs.\u201d\u2026 Siraj Ibn Wahhaj\u2019s lawyer in the state case, suggested that those charges were motivated by a degree of racial and religious prejudice against his Muslim client. If the suspects were white Christians shooting guns on their property and practicing their religion, \u201cNo one would bat an eye,\u201d Thomas Clark argued in court. \u201cIf these were white people of a Christian faith who owned guns, that\u2019s not a big deal because there\u2019s a Second Amendment right to own firearms in this country. If these were white Christians, faith healing is of no consequence because we have freedom of religion in this country. But they look different and they worship differently from the rest of us,\u201d Clark said\u2026. Last month, two state judges were forced to dismiss child neglect charges against all five adults when the local district attorney\u2019s office missed a 10-day deadline to present initial evidence of crime. A few days later, Taos-based District Attorney Donald Gallegos dropped charges related to the death of Siraj Wahhaj\u2019s son, \u201csaying he was seeking more time to assemble and analyze evidence, and that he intended to seek grand jury indictment,\u201d The Durango Herald reported.

An off-duty police officer walked into the wrong home after getting off shift, thought the homeowner was an intruder, and killed him. And, she has not yet been arrested. The victim was 26-year-old Bothan Shem Jean who was most likely startled by someone coming into his home at 10:00 pm when the unnamed officer opened his door. While the details surrounding how Jean was killed are unclear, according to police, the officer admitted to killing him. In a statement released on Friday, Dallas police said their officer called them after shooting Jean and told responding officers that \u201cshe entered the victim\u2019s apartment believing that it was her own.\u201d take our poll - story continues below Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?

On September 6, 2018 at about 9:59 p.m., an off duty Dallas Police officer called police dispatch and said she was involved in a shooting at the apartments located at 1210 S. Lamar. Preliminary information suggests that the officer arrived home in full uniform after working a full shift. The officer reported to the responding officers that she entered the victim\u2019s apartment believing that it was her own. At some point, the officer fired her weapon striking the victim. Responding officers administered aid to the victim, a 26-year-old male, at the scene. The victim was then transported to the hospital and pronounced deceased. Next of kin notification has not been made at this time. The officer was not injured and will be placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation. The Dallas Police Department is conducting a joint investigation with the District Attorney\u2019s Office. This investigation is ongoing and we will release additional details as they become available and it is appropriate to do so. If an average citizen walked into the wrong home and shot and killed an innocent homeowner, rest assured that they would be in jail\u2014right now. However, instead of immediately arresting the officer for trespassing and murder, she was simply placed on administrative leave\u2014a glaring function of blue privilege indeed. \u201cSuper scary because the police are supposed to protect you and then they come home and, you know, you\u2019re just hanging out in your own house and then they come home thinking they\u2019re home or whatever.

While the Free Thought Project consistently reports on police officers entering the wrong home during raids and killing, maiming, or traumatizing entirely innocent people, this is the first time we\u2019ve reported a story of an off-duty cop going into the wrong home, on their way home, and killing someone. The details of how or why this officer would walk into an apartment that was not hers are unclear. However, what is entirely clear is the fact that a mother and father are now and will be grieving for the rest of their lives because of her actions. And, in a slap to the face of Jean\u2019s parents, the person who admitted to killing their innocent son has yet to be arrested.

(AP) - Federal prosecutors say the FBI has arrested five former residents of a ramshackle compound in New Mexico on firearms and conspiracy charges as local prosecutors dropped charges in the death of a 3-year-old boy at the property. Taos County District Attorney Donald Gallegos said Friday his office will now seek grand jury indictments involving the death. Gallegos said seeking indictments will allow more time to gather evidence. All five people will remain in custody pending a Tuesday hearing in federal court. The U.S. Attorney's Office in Albuquerque said compound resident Jany Leveille has been charged with being an alien unlawfully in possession of firearms and ammunition. She is a Haitian national. The other four members are charged with conspiring with Leveille. And the death of the three-year-old? Nothing! And what of the training of little jihadis? Nothing! \u201cThe defendants, Jany Leveille, 35, a Haitian national illegally present in the United States, Siraj Ibn Wahhaj, 40, Hujrah Wahhaj, 37, Subhanah Wahhaj, 35, and Lucas Morton, 40, are charged in a criminal complaint that was filed earlier today in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico,\u201d the bureau said in a statement. \u201cThe criminal complaint charges Jany Leveille with being an alien unlawfully in possession of firearms and ammunition in the District of New Mexico from Nov. 2017 through Aug. 2018,\u201d the bureau said. \u201cThe criminal complaint charges the other four defendants with aiding and abetting Leveille in committing the offense, and with conspiring with Leveille to commit the offense.\u201d Yet, in the midst of all of this, don't forget that the FBI ignore the intelligence that was provided to them, just like they have in many cases, which, if they had acted, they may have saved the little boy's life. In the meantime, the New Mexico district attorney who failed to file for a preliminary hearing within 10 days and didn\u2019t show up for court is vowing to pursue prosecution of these jihadis. \u201cThe actions yesterday by the district judges do not affect our continuing efforts to prosecute the individuals as charged originally,\u201d Eighth Judicial District Attorney Donald Gallegos said in a statement on Thursday. \u201cWhile we disagree with the judges, they did their jobs. We will continue to do ours. \u201cGoing forward, our options are to refile the charges or take the cases to the grand jury. We are assessing and will decide which avenue to pursue. What is important to know is that we will continue to pursue prosecution of the cases.\u201d StatementThe actions yesterday by the district judges do not affect our continuing efforts to prosecute the... Posted by Eighth Judicial District Attorney on Thursday, August 30, 2018 He also sought to fight back against criticism in his failure to perform his job. \u201cFinally, I have always welcomed criticism and, as public servants, our judges should also,\u201d Gallegos said in the statement. \u201cHowever, I ask that you be civil and respectful in your criticisms as that is more constructive. Cussing and threatening the people involved will not accomplish justice and serves no useful purpose. Remember, you do not have all the facts. That will develop as the cases progress.\" Yeah, well, that's about as trustworthy as the FBI in this matter. This latest move, while welcome, may only be a response to President Donald Trump's vow to \"get involved.\" However, I ask, why were you not involved in the first place, Mr. President? According to the Constitution, you, and you alone, are the sole head of the executive branch, and as such you are where the buck stop in making sure the laws are faithfully executed. So, if Trump is going to fire Sessions, perhaps he should stop talking about it and get to it and actually put someone in the Justice Department as attorney general who will do the job faithfully, and by that, I don't mean Trey Gowdy. I mean someone who is serious about justice, not political grandstanding or covering up criminal activity. Until then, I'll consider this the means the FBI will use to engage in the further coverup of what really took place at that compound beyond the bulldozing of a crime scene, and possibly, their own complicity.

By Andrew Hay, Reuters, September 2, 2018: The boy was among 11 children and five adults living at the compound in Taos County when it was raided on Aug. 3 by local sheriff\u2019s deputies who discovered a cache of firearms and the children living without food or clean water.

We don\u2019t see eye-to-eye on everything, of course, but his faith and pastoral solicitude have for us been a light in the darkness and proof that God has not left us orphans. And now this, finally, a bishop with the courage to look the beast in the eye and speak its name out loud. Bishop Morlino does this in a moment when he is under heavy attack as a \u201chater\u201d for defending the Church\u2019s teaching on marriage\u2014an attack, by the way, which prompted us here at The Remnant to join the fight to DEFEND BISHOP MORLINO last year. \"If you'll permit me, what the Church needs now is more hatred! As I have said previously, St. Thomas Aquinas said that hatred of wickedness actually belongs to the virtue of charity. As the Book of Proverbs says 'My mouth shall meditate truth, and my lips shall hate wickedness (Prov. 8:7).' It is an act of love to hate sin and to call others to turn away from sin. \u2013 Bishop Robert Morlino This is what a courageous shepherd looks like! In our opinion, during the most vile clergy sex scandal in history, every bishop in the country must do exactly what Bishop Morlino has done, i.e., issue a statement of fidelity to the Church\u2019s moral theology, specifically her teaching against the mortal sin of homosexual acts. In so doing, the bishops will incur the wrath of the enemies of the Church, yes. They will be crucified in the media, yes. But they will also be doing their sacred duty before God in reassuring their thoroughly scandalized flocks that they are absolutely committed to the defense and enforcement of the Church\u2019s moral teaching at a time when it is under scurrilous attack from within. Nothing less will do. Bishop Morlino has now done it, and we respectfully demand that the rest of the American bishops either follow suit or face the charge of being complicit with the degenerate and even criminal shepherds, accounts of whose betrayal and vice now dominate the news. May God bless and keep Bishop Robert Morlino. MJM Bishop Robert C. Morlino's letter to the faithful on the ongoing sexual abuse crisis in the Church August 18, 2018 Dear brothers and sisters in Christ of the Diocese of Madison, The past weeks have brought a great deal of scandal, justified anger, and a call for answers and action by many faithful Catholics here in the U.S. and overseas, directed at the Church hierarchy regarding sexual sins by bishops, priests, and even cardinals. Still more anger is rightly directed at those who have been complicit in keeping some of these serious sins from coming to light. For my part \u2014 and I know I am not alone \u2014 I am tired of this. I am tired of people being hurt, gravely hurt! I am tired of the obfuscation of truth. I am tired of sin. And, as one who has tried \u2014 despite my many imperfections \u2014 to lay down my life for Christ and His Church, I am tired of the regular violation of sacred duties by those entrusted with immense responsibility from the Lord for the care of His people. The stories being brought into light and displayed in gruesome detail with regard to some priests, religious, and now even those in places of highest leadership, are sickening. Hearing even one of these stories is, quite literally, enough to make someone sick. But my own sickness at the stories is quickly put into perspective when I recall the fact that many individuals have lived through them for years. For them, these are not stories, they are indeed realities. To them I turn and say, again, I am sorry for what you have suffered and what you continue to suffer in your mind and in your heart. If you have not already done so, I beg you to reach out, as hard as that may be, and seek help to begin to heal. Also, if you\u2019ve been hurt by a priest of our diocese, I encourage you to come forward, to make a report to law enforcement and to our Victim\u2019s Assistance Coordinator, so that we might begin, with you as an individual, to try and set things right to the greatest extent possible. There is nothing about these stories that is okay. These actions, committed by more than a few, can only be classified as evil, evil that cries out for justice and sin that must be cast out from our Church. Faced with stories of the depravity of sinners within the Church, I have been tempted to despair. And why? The reality of sin \u2014 even sin in the Church \u2014 is nothing new. We are a Church made of sinners, but we are sinners called to sanctity. So what is new? What is new is the seeming acceptance of sin by some in the Church, and the apparent efforts to cover over sin by them and others. Unless and until we take seriously our call to sanctity, we, as an institution and as individuals, will continue to suffer the \u201cwages of sin.\u201d For too long we have diminished the reality of sin \u2014 we have refused to call a sin a sin \u2014 and we have excused sin in the name of a mistaken notion of mercy. In our efforts to be open to the world we have become all too willing to abandon the Way, the Truth, and the Life.

            "question": "Which of the following tactics is used in the following text?\n\nArticle: THE OPPORTUNITIES AND RISKS OF TRUMP'S IRAN INITIATIVE Originally published the Jerusalem Post. On Friday, US President Donald Trump initiated an important change in US policy toward Iran. No, in his speech decertifying Iran\u2019s compliance with the nuclear accord it struck with his predecessor Barack Obama, Trump didn\u2019t announce a new strategy for preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, or stemming its hegemonic rise in the Middle East, or limiting its ability to sponsor terrorism. Trump\u2019s move was not operational. It was directional. In his address Friday, Trump changed the policy dynamics that dictate US policy on Iran. For the first time since 2009, when Obama backed the murderous regime in Tehran, spurning the millions of Iranians who rose up in the Green Revolution, Trump opened up the possibility that the US may begin to base its policies toward Iran on reality. Trump began his remarks by setting out Iran\u2019s long rap sheet of aggression against America. Starting with the US embassy seizure and hostage crisis, Trump described Iran\u2019s crimes and acts of war against America in greater detail than any of his predecessors ever did. Trump\u2019s dossier was interlaced with condemnations of the regime\u2019s repression of its own people. By merging Iran\u2019s external aggression with its internal repression, Trump signaled a readiness to drive a wedge \u2013 or expand the wedge \u2013 between the authoritarian theocrats that rule Iran and the largely secular, multiethnic and pro-Western people of Iran. Trump then turned his attention to Iran\u2019s illicit ballistic missile program, its sponsorship of terrorism, including its links to al-Qaida, its aggression against its neighbors, its aggressive acts against maritime traffic in the Straits of Hormuz, and its bids to destabilize and control large swaths of the Middle East through its proxies. It is notable that these remarks preceded Trump\u2019s discussion of the nuclear deal \u2013 which was the ostensible subject of his speech. Before Trump discussed Iran\u2019s breaches of the nuclear deal, he first demonstrated that contrary to the expressed views of his top advisers, it is impossible to limit a realistic discussion of the threat Iran constitutes to US national security and interests to whether or not and it what manner it is breaching the nuclear accord. This was a critical point because for the past two years, US discourse on Iran has focused solely on whether or not Iran was complying with Obama\u2019s nuclear pact. By placing the nuclear deal in the context of Iran\u2019s consistent, overarching hostility and aggression, Trump made it self-evident that no US interest is served in continuing to give Iran a free pass from congressional sanctions. After accomplishing that goal, Trump turned his attention to how Iran is actually breaching the letter and spirit of the nuclear pact. Only then, almost as an afterthought, did he announce that he was decertifying Iranian compliance with the nuclear deal, setting the conditions for the renewal of congressional sanctions on Iran and opening the floodgates of congressional sanctions on Iran in retaliation for the full spectrum of its aggressive and illicit acts against the US, its interests and allies. By empowering Congress to prohibit economic cooperation with Iran, Trump put the Europeans, Chinese and Russians on notice that they may soon face a choice between conducting business with the US and conducting business with Iran. After putting them on notice, Trump discussed the possibility of improving Obama\u2019s nuclear accord. Among other things, he suggested expanding the inspection regime against Iran\u2019s nuclear installations and canceling the so-called \u201csunset\u201d clause that places an end date on the restrictions governing certain components of Iran\u2019s nuclear advancement. Trump\u2019s address has the potential to serve as the foundation of a major, positive shift in US policy toward Iran. Such a shift could potentially facilitate the achievement of Trump\u2019s goals of preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, containing its regional aggression and empowerment and defeating its terrorist proxies. Unfortunately, it is also likely, indeed, it is more likely, that his words will not be translated into policies to achieve these critical aims. Trump\u2019s decision to transfer immediate responsibility to Congress for holding Iran accountable for its hostile actions on the military and other fronts is a risky move. He has a lot of enemies, and the nuclear deal has a lot of supporters on Capitol Hill. Obama would have never been able to implement his nuclear deal if Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, hadn\u2019t agreed to cast the Constitution aside and ignore Obama\u2019s constitutional duty to present the nuclear deal to the Senate for ratification as a treaty. Over the past week, Trump and Corker have been involved in an ugly public fight precipitated by Corker\u2019s announcement that he will not be seeking reelection next year. Today Corker has nothing to restrain him from scuttling Trump\u2019s agenda. If he wishes, out of spite, Corker can block effective sanctions from being passed. And he may do so even though the implications for his Senate colleagues would be dire and even though doing so would render him an unofficial protector of Iran\u2019s nuclear program. What is true for Corker is doubly true for the Democrats. Leading Democratic senators like Robert Menendez, Ben Cardin and Chuck Schumer, who opposed Obama\u2019s Iran deal may now feel that as opponents of the Trump administration, they are required to oppose any change to the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act. Indeed, given the rise of radical forces in their party it is likely that they would rather give Iran a free pass for its anti-American aggression and nuclear proliferation than work with Republicans on Capitol Hill and in the White House. Then again, by framing the issue of Iran\u2019s threat to America as he did, and by transferring responsibility for reinstating sanctions and passing further sanctions on Iran to Congress, Trump opened up the possibility that Congress will conduct substantive \u2013 rather than personal \u2013 debates on Iran.

John Pilger: His state of health is just about the same, as I understand it. He needs medical attention, the kind of treatment you get only in a hospital. But it has been made clear to him that if he attempts to go to a hospital he will not be given free passage and he will be arrested. Since he was arrested in 2010, Assange has not been charged with a single crime. His treatment amounts to the most unprecedented persecution. Julian could leave the embassy if his own government, the government of his homeland, Australia, applied legitimate diplomatic pressure on behalf of its citizen. We must ask ourselves why this hasn\u2019t happened. My own feeling is that there is a great deal of collusion between the Australian, the British and the US governments\u2013meant to close down WikiLeaks completely and/or deliver Julian Assange to the Americans. Recently the Australian foreign minister, Julie Bishop, traveled with senior officials to London and to Washington and raised the whole matter of Julian. But they raised it in a way that didn\u2019t support the idea that a government should represent its citizens. These people listened to the more powerful governments. In Washington they met Mr. Pompeo, who refused to discuss Assange altogether. I think there is collusion which amounts to an attempt to try to do a deal with Assange whereby he might be allowed free passage of return to Australia if he shuts down WikiLeaks. I think that is very, very likely. As I understand Julian, this is something he would not even contemplate. But that might be one of the so-called \u201cwretched deals\u201d that are being offered Assange. Some very strange things are being said by senior members of these two governments. The new foreign secretary of the United Kingdom, Jeremy Hunt, said sarcastically that the British police would offer Julian \u201ca warm welcome\u201d when he came out, when he would face serious charges. There are no serious charges. He hasn\u2019t been charged with anything. Special Ed: Voices fro... Dennis Bernstein Best Price: $2.49 Buy New $5.00 (as of 06:30 EDT - Details) Was Hunt referring to a deal which has already been done with the United States on extradition? I don\u2019t know. But this is the milieu of machination around someone who has the right of natural justice concerning his freedom. Putting aside freedom of speech, the persecution of this man has been something that should horrify all free-thinking people. If it doesn\u2019t horrify us, then we have surrendered something very valuable. DB: Among those who should be especially horrified are those of us in the journalistic community. John, I would like you to explain once again why Julian Assange is such a significant journalist, why so many journalistic institutions have collaborated with him based on the information he provided. We are talking about a publisher and reporter who has changed history. JP: Nothing in my time as a journalist has equaled the rise of WikiLeaks and its extraordinary impact on journalism. It is probably the only journalistic organization that has a 100% record of accuracy and authenticity! All of WikiLeaks\u2019 revelations have been authentic. And it has been done \u201cwithout fear or favor.\u201d Although there has been a concentration on, say, the release of the Hillary Clinton/Podesta emails, or the Iraq and Afghan war logs, WikiLeaks has released information that people have a right to know across the spectrum. It has released something like 800,000 documents from Russia, and now WikiLeaks is accused of being an agent of Russia! WikiLeaks\u2019 journalism has covered a universal space and that is the first time this has happened. In Tunisia, the release of WikiLeaks documents foretold the Arab Spring. The people at the forefront of the uprising in Tunisia credit WikiLeaks for informing them of what their repressive government was doing behind their backs. In Venezuela, WikiLeaks released cables which described in great detail how the United States intended to subvert the government of Hugo Chavez. Some of this was published in the mainstream media, when there was still a collaboration with WikiLeaks. The Clinton/Podesta emails, which appear to have made a number of people resentful, were published in the New York Times. These emails showed the close role that Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation played in support of extreme jihadism in the Middle East. That was a very important piece of information for people to know and understand. By doing that, WikiLeaks performed an extraordinary public service, while at the same time making some very serious enemies. Randy Credico: People sometimes forget that, apart from being a journalist, Julian Assange is a human being. You have known him a long time. Could you give us a feel for the kind of person Julian Assange is? JP: Julian is a very principled individual. He feels very strongly about the moral basis of WikiLeaks. When he first put up WikiLeaks, he wrote that the whole idea of transparency, honoring people\u2019s right to know, was the central aim of the website. He feels that very strongly. Any attempt to do a deal with Julian to shut down WikiLeaks will no doubt be resisted. As a person, Julian is an extremely interesting man. He is very well read. He studied physics. He has a very good sense of humor, and I have often laughed out loud with him about situations that others might consider too bleak to discuss. His black humor is a part of his survival kit. Obviously, he is incredibly resilient. Personally, I could never endure what he has, especially in recent years. But this comes with a cost and his health is continuing to deteriorate. Those close to him are extremely worried. Cypherpunks: Freedom a... Julian Assange Best Price: $3.04 Buy New $9.55 (as of 06:45 EDT - Details)\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

From TPM: The Photo That Never Saw The Light of Day: Obama With Farrakhan In 2005 By Esme Cribb | January 25, 2018 2:16 pm A journalist announced last week that he will publish a photograph of then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama (D) and Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan that he took in 2005 at a Congressional Black Caucus meeting, but did not make public because he believed it would have \u201cmade a difference\u201d to Obama\u2019s political future. The photographer, Askia Muhammad, told the Trice Edney News Wire that he \u201cgave the picture up at the time and basically swore secrecy.\u201d \u201cBut after the nomination was secured and all the way up until the inauguration; then for eight years after he was President, it was kept under cover,\u201d Muhammad said. Asked whether he thought the photo\u2019s release would have affected Obama\u2019s presidential campaign, Muhammad said, \u201cI insist. It absolutely would have made a difference.\u201d Reached by TPM on Thursday, Muhammad said a \u201cstaff member\u201d for the CBC contacted him \u201csort of in a panic\u201d after he took the photo at a caucus meeting in 2005. TPM has published the photo above with Muhammad\u2019s permission. \u201cI sort of understood what was going on,\u201d Muhammad told TPM. \u201cI promised and made arrangements to give the picture to Leonard Farrakhan,\u201d the minister\u2019s son-in-law and chief of staff. Muhammad said he gave away \u201cthe disk\u201d from his camera but \u201ccopied the photograph from that day onto a file\u201d on his computer. \u201cRealizing that I had given it up, I mean, it was sort of like a promise to keep the photograph secret,\u201d Muhammad said. Muhammad said he did not release his copy of the photograph because he thought it would be perceived as a betrayal of that promise: \u201cI was really, I guess, afraid of them.\u201d Malcolm X wasn\u2019t adequately afraid of them. Here\u2019s what happened to him: https://youtu.be/qSm1t3Uv9QI Muhammad said he thought the photograph would be \u201cdamaging politically\u201d if it were released and was afraid that someone might \u201cbreak into his apartment\u201d looking for it, like \u201cthat Watergate crap.\u201d He said he \u201cfelt a little bit more at ease\u201d after Farrakhan in 2016 claimed that Obama visited his home in Chicago. Muhammad contacted Farrakhan in autumn 2017 with the \u201cfinal manuscript\u201d for a self-published book containing the photo. \u201cI sent him a copy of the manuscript suggesting that, showing him the picture, and saying to him, if he did not object, I was going to publish it,\u201d Muhammad said. \u201cHe had no objection.\u201d \u2026 During Obama\u2019s presidential campaign, conservatives pushed multiple apparently racially motivated conspiracy theories about Obama\u2019s religion and supposed ties to Islam. For example, in Obama\u2019s memoir subtitled A Story of Race and Inheritance, Obama recounts his being a regular reader of Minister Farrakhan\u2019s Nation of Islam newspaper The Final Call. Obama recollects Farrakhan\u2019s black nationalist capitalist campaign to get black people to use toothpaste manufactured by black-owned businesses. Farrakhan\u2019s eventual failure suggests to Obama that\u2019s there is more economic upside for blacks in shaking down white institutions than in building their own. During the 2008 presidential election, conservatives questioned the indirect ties between Farrakhan and Obama, who attended a church that gave Farrakhan an award. Obama\u2019s \u201cspiritual advisor\u201d Rev. Jeremiah Wright gave Farrakhan his church\u2019s Lifetime Achievement award in a downtown Chicago Hyatt Regency in November 2007, but the story didn\u2019t make the press until the following year. Similarly, very little media attention was paid to the close relationship between Obama\u2019s fundraiser and private mentor Tony Rezko and the Nation of Islam, even though Rezko\u2019s role was business manager for Nation of Islam assets, such as the career of Muhammad Ali. But after all, what could be more boring than a story than involves a Presidential candidate, the Syrian Christian crook who helped him buy his house, the Nation of Islam, and the most famous boxer of all time? Reading Obama\u2019s 1995 memoir, you might almost get the impression that after a prudent first term, during his second he might side with, I dunno, Black Lives Matter and encourage a wave of black rage and police retreat that drove up the death toll from murder by 20% in his last two years in office, an incremental death toll a little bigger than the U.S. combat death toll from the equally stupid Iraq War.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

The Democrat leadership collusion with Muslim spies is the biggest story of treason and espionage in the recent memory, and yet for month after month the media has refused to cover it. Instead, they\u2019re so hellbent on destroying President Trump that they have directed all their energy to retailing Soviet fictions and titillating porn stories. House investigators found the House server was being used for nefarious purposes: the alleged Muslim spies were removing information and sending it for foreign actors. take our poll - story continues below Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?

The aides named are Imran Awan, his wife Hina Alvi, his brothers Abid and Jamal, and his friend Rao Abbas, Pakistani-born aides. And the father of Muslim spy ring Imran Awan transferred a USB drive to a Pakistani senator and former head of a Pakistani intelligence agency. Capitol Police are looking into the massive amounts of data the Awans reportedly downloaded off the congressional system, thousands of illegal logins made on the official system, possible theft of tens of thousands of dollars in congressional equipment and fraud and sent to foreign governments and groups. No wonder the Democrats tried to squirrel these jihad spies out of the country. Congress must investigate and act. \u201cWitness Said Awan Wiretapped Her, Then Bank Account She Controlled Was Drained,\u201d by Luke Rosiak, Daily Caller News Foundation, May 21, 2018 (thanks to Todd): After former Democratic IT aide Imran Awan allegedly threatened his stepmother not to talk to police, her email account was accessed in suspicious ways and a lawyer for one of Awan\u2019s brothers found out she emailed the FBI on specific dates and lashed out at her: \u201cYou\u2019re a liar, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Days after that, a bank account the stepmother controlled was almost completely drained through a payment to Imran\u2019s brother, Abid Awan, bank records show \u2014 but she said she is too afraid to press criminal charges because she claims he has threatened her. The stepmother, Samina Gilani, also previously said Imran stole two laptops from her. Imran, Abid and Jamal Awan \u2014 along with Imran\u2019s wife, Hina Alvi, and a friend \u2014 worked as IT administrators for 1 out of every 5 House Democrats and could read all their emails and files until police banned them from the network in February 2017for \u201cnumerous violations of House security policies.\u201d Months later, none of the family is in jail, and the stepmother and other witnesses have said Imran and Abid have used their freedom to try to steer the outcome of the case since, including by threatening them not to cooperate with authorities, TheDCNF previously reported. In April 2016, the House\u2019s Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) detected allegedly falsified purchase orders, and the Inspector General quickly expanded the scope to investigate cyber violations, finding that members of the Awan family improperly accessed congressmen\u2019s servers and the House Democratic Caucus server thousands of times. Though House officials suspected that equipment was being stolen, the Capitol Police did not search their homes, The Daily Caller News Foundation learned, and did not ban them from the network until nearly a year later. In the meantime, evidence appears to have been compromised: In December 2016, the CAO notified congressmen that the caucus server had physically disappeared. Though Abid played a prominent role in the late-2016 IG report, he has not been arrested, with congressmen saying a criminal investigation is ongoing. In January 2017, in the days around his father\u2019s death, Abid removed Gilani as the beneficiary of his father\u2019s life insurance and replaced her with himself, which led to a lawsuit, TheDCNF previously reported. Abid\u2019s attorney, Jim Bacon, used the life insurance lawsuit to force Gilani to sit for a sworn deposition Oct. 4, 2017 in which he told her to reveal what she told the FBI about the congressional criminal probe and tried to get her to find out details from investigators. In one exchange, Bacon knew that she had emailed with the FBI. BACON Q: [redacted] is your email address, isn\u2019t it? And you send emails from that address including two emails to the FBI, didn\u2019t you? GILANI A: Yes, a long time ago. Q: No, not a long time ago. March 5th, 2017. March 6th, 2017. Ma\u2019am, you lied to me, didn\u2019t you? You lied to me, didn\u2019t you? You\u2019re a liar, aren\u2019t you? A: I forgot about that. It was not in my mind. BACON: Ah. I think we need to take a break before I explode. Bacon did not respond to questions from the TheDCNF about how he knew Gilani had emailed the FBI on those dates\u2026.

Without a shred of evidence, a highly qualified judge, with no other blemish on his record, is being smeared on the national stage by a political lynch mob out for blood. Ben Shapiro spoke to Fox News' Martha MacCallum and said \"you have to have some evidence before you destroy a man's life.\" Shapiro's comments can be heard in the video below. Jeanine Pirro spoke to Hannity on Thursday night and asked, \"Since when does truth and justice or guilt and innocence depend on your political party. I fear for this nation when this is now the standard. You believe any woman who goes against a Republican and you don't believe any woman who goes against a Democrat.\" She continued. \"I worry about this country. I don't want these people to sit on juries. It's no longer about truth and justice. It's about politics.\" Hannity asks, \"Why are people willing to throw out due process, equal justice under the law and the presumption of innocence?\" Gregg Jarrett says it's \"because they're zealous to the point where they've lost their common sense.\" Their commentary on the video below is interesting. Sen. Charles Grassley (R-IA) is to be commended on his handling of the situation. In the spirit of compromise, he called off the Senate committee vote that had been on the calendar for Thursday and scheduled a hearing for next Monday so that both Christine Ford and Brett Kavanaugh could state their cases. Kavanaugh immediately responded to Grassley. For 36 hours, there was silence from the Ford camp. Then, their demands began. First, it was reported that Ford would answer questions, but only at a closed hearing and only after an FBI investigation had been completed. Republicans felt that the request for a closed hearing was reasonable, but the demand for a new FBI investigation was not. The FBI investigates federal crimes and/or national security issues. When the FBI received Dianne Feinstein\u2019s letter last week, they forwarded it to the White House to place in Kavanaugh\u2019s background check file. (Note: The FBI has already conducted six background checks on Kavanaugh, the most recent one was done this summer.) It was announced later that Sen. Grassley would not change the date of the hearing set for Monday. Even Senators Jeff Flake, Bob Corker and Lindsey Graham, who have all said Ford needs to be heard, have indicated that if she does not show up for Monday's hearing, they will schedule a vote on Kavanaugh's confirmation. On Thursday afternoon, Ford's highly partisan, activist attorney emailed Grassley saying, although her client strongly prefers that an investigation take place beforehand, Ford will testify next week, but she cannot do so on Monday. And she will only be questioned by members of the Senate panel, not outside lawyers. Why not Monday? Does she have an important dentist appointment she can't get out of? In order to avoid the criticism that will no doubt come anyway, the Republicans on the Senate Judicial committee have tried very hard to oblige Ford's requests, even offering to go to California to hear her testimony. She and her attorneys feel that they are in the driver's seat and thus, can call all the shots. Democrats want to delay this vote until after the midterms because they believe they have a chance to retake the Senate as well as the House. Rush Limbaugh points out that the Senate has bent over backwards to accommodate the accuser. \"I don\u2019t care who you are, determine the scope and the parameters of an investigation. The accuser doesn\u2019t get to determine when and who investigates. In no circumstance in the country does that happen.\" In addition to the political reasons for the delay requests, it appears as if this woman is reluctant to testify under oath, possibly because she doesn\u2019t want to perjure herself. Maybe she realizes the magnitude of what her accusations have unleashed. Either this did not happen at all or a much milder version of the situation she alleges occurred.

While aboard Air Force One, the president killed some time by picking up the phone and ringing associates to ask them if they thought Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report would be sent to the Department of Justice this week, according to a source with knowledge of these conversations. The report, which would mark the culmination of Mueller and his team\u2019s investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and potential obstruction of justice, has for many months kicked off round after round of speculation among the media and political class about when, exactly, it will finally be delivered to the Justice Department. This week, the President of the United States himself joined in on the anxious anticipation and the Mueller report guessing game. According to three knowledgeable sources, Trump has quizzed various people\u2014administration officials, friends, his legal team\u2014throughout the week if they believed the buzz that the Mueller report could be delivered as soon as this week. The president, these sources said, speculated on when he thought it would finally happen, repeatedly citing news reports from this week on a possible imminent delivery. Reached for comment, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders replied that there was \u201cnothing to add right now,\u201d as of Friday afternoon. \u201cI told the president this morning [to] go about your schedule, we\u2019re prepared for anything,\u201d Rudy Giuliani, one of Trump\u2019s personal attorneys, told The Daily Beast on Friday, adding that he spoke with the president in person on Thursday. Giuliani said that he and the president have been hearing the report delivery could happen \u201ctoday,\u201d but clarified that he and his client are going off of media, not any \u201cinsider information.\u201d Trump\u2019s reelection campaign also got in on this week\u2019s speculation game, texting supporters early Friday afternoon, \u201cPresident Trump has put up with the WITCH HUNT for 2 YEARS. Do you think it's time for it to end? Take our OFFICIAL poll NOW.\u201d The president, who has repeatedly claimed that the Mueller investigation is \u201cillegal\u201d and a \u201cWITCH HUNT\u201d driven by angry liberals, made clear to reporters at the White House earlier this week that the coming report was, of course, weighing on him. \u201cLet it come out, let people see it,\u201d Trump said, characterizing the probe and report as \u201cridiculous,\u201d as he left the White House on Wednesday. \u201cLet\u2019s see whether or not it\u2019s legit.\u201d But over the course of the last two years, he hasn\u2019t always been so open to the report seeing the light of day, or even having the investigation conclude. As The New York Times reported early last year, Trump ordered the firing of the special counsel, but reversed course after the then-White House Counsel Don McGahn said he would resign instead of executing Trump\u2019s order. Still, even after the Mueller probe officially wraps, it is very much the beginning, not a dramatic end, to Trumpworld\u2019s wide-ranging legal woes. On Friday, The Washington Post reported that Democratic chairs of six different House committees investigating Trump and his allies are planning on asking the FBI, Department of Justice, and White House to preserve records provided to Mueller and his investigators. President Trump himself appears to realize that the end is nowhere near. As The Daily Beast reported last month, the president made clear to his outside legal team, which includes Giuliani and Jay Sekulow, that he wanted his attorneys sitting tight, even after the Mueller investigation is history. Trump broached the topic in multiple conversations beginning late last year, while discussing the other inquiries threatening his presidency and inner circle, chief among them the Southern District of New York. But if the Mueller report is actually, finally sent over to the Justice Department by close of business on Friday, the president will be many miles away from it. On Friday morning, Trump flew to Palm Beach, Florida, where he and first lady Melania Trump were scheduled to meet with Caribbean leaders at Mar-a-Lago, the president\u2019s private club and getaway.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

The LA Times refused to release a video of the infamous Jew-hating event Obama hosted with close confidante and infamous antisemite Rashid Khalidi. The media gave scant coverage to Obama\u2019s close relationship with radical Reverend Jeremiah \u201cGod damn America) Wright who blamed the US for 9/11. I detailed Obama\u2019s nefarious connections and resulting worldview in my book, The Post-American Presidency: The Obama Administration\u2019s War on America , which was ignored by the mainstream media. The Muslim photographer Askia Muhammad, who took this photo of candidate Barack Obama and vicious jihad-supporting racist Louis Farrakhan, knew this would impact the election: he said so. And so he conspired with the terror group, the Nation of Islam, to keep it hidden for 10 years. He has served as the editor of Muhammad Speaks and as the head of the Washington office of The Final Call, the official newspapers of the Nation of Islam.[4][5] He has worked as a commentator for National Public Radio and a columnist for Washington Informer.[6][7] (Wikipedia) The photographer, Askia Muhammad, told the Trice Edney News Wire that he \u201cgave the picture up at the time and basically swore secrecy.\u201d\u201cBut after the nomination was secured and all the way up until the inauguration; then for eight years after he was President, it was kept under cover,\u201d Muhammad said. Asked whether he thought the photo\u2019s release would have affected Obama\u2019s presidential campaign, Muhammad said, \u201cI insist. It absolutely would have made a difference.\u201d Farrakhan In His Own Words (PDF). Some Farrakhan quotes: \u201cThe Jews don\u2019t like Farrakhan, so they call me Hitler. Well, that\u2019s a good name. Hitler was a very great man.\u201d \u201cMy god will wipe this country (America) from the face of the earth.\u201d On on the Jewish people: \u201cYou are wicked deceivers of the American people. You have sucked their blood.\u201d \u201cThe Jews don\u2019t like Farrakhan, so they call me Hitler. Well, that\u2019s a good name. Hitler was a very great man.\u201d \u201cYou are not now, nor have you ever been a citizen of America. You are a slave to white America.\u201d \u201cAmerica is in trouble, and I say God is about to wipe this nation from the face of the Earth. I\u2019m not crazy, I\u2019m not drunk, how long do you think a nation can do evil and not face the wrath of god?\u201d \u201cYou see everybody always talk about Hitler exterminating six million Jews. That\u2019s right. But don\u2019t nobody ever ask what did they do to Hitler.\u201d White people are potential humans \u2013 they haven\u2019t evolved yet. On Hezbollah: \u201cThey call them terrorists, I call them freedom fighters.\u201d \u201cThe Mother Wheel is a heavily armed spaceship the size of a city, which will rain destruction upon white America but save those who embrace the Nation of Islam.\u201d THE PHOTO THAT NEVER SAW THE LIGHT OF DAY: OBAMA WITH FARRAKHAN IN 2005 By Esme Cribb | Talking Point Memo January 25, 2018 2:16 pm Askia Muhammad A journalist announced last week that he will publish a photograph of then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama (D) and Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan that he took in 2005 at a Congressional Black Caucus meeting, but did not make public because he believed it would have \u201cmade a difference\u201d to Obama\u2019s political future. The photographer, Askia Muhammad, told the Trice Edney News Wire that he \u201cgave the picture up at the time and basically swore secrecy.\u201d \u201cBut after the nomination was secured and all the way up until the inauguration; then for eight years after he was President, it was kept under cover,\u201d Muhammad said. Asked whether he thought the photo\u2019s release would have affected Obama\u2019s presidential campaign, Muhammad said, \u201cI insist. It absolutely would have made a difference.\u201d Reached by TPM on Thursday, Muhammad said a \u201cstaff member\u201d for the CBC contacted him \u201csort of in a panic\u201d after he took the photo at a caucus meeting in 2005. TPM has published the photo above with Muhammad\u2019s permission. \u201cI sort of understood what was going on,\u201d Muhammad told TPM. \u201cI promised and made arrangements to give the picture to Leonard Farrakhan,\u201d the minister\u2019s son-in-law and chief of staff. Muhammad said he gave away \u201cthe disk\u201d from his camera but \u201ccopied the photograph from that day onto a file\u201d on his computer. \u201cRealizing that I had given it up, I mean, it was sort of like a promise to keep the photograph secret,\u201d Muhammad said.

Keith Ellison (D-MN), who is running for attorney general in Minnesota without an active attorney's license, has not stood before a committee to deny or address accusations against him by several women who have accused him of verbal and physical abuse. At least one woman even filed a police report about his abuse. No, Ellison has called on the House of Representatives, not the FBI, as Senate Democrats have urged in the case of Judge Kavanaugh, to investigate the claims. \"I am taking this step now because I am innocent and eager to see this entire matter resolved,\u201d Ellison said in a statement. \u201cThese allegations have lingered in the public sphere, and remain unsubstantiated,\" he added. \"I welcome an investigation by the House to allow us to move on.\" take our poll - story continues below Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?

Well, that's not entirely accurate. We do have a police report, unlike the accusations against Brett Kavanaugh. Of course, his supporters have hired an attorney to perform an investigation. The Star Tribune reports: The Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party has hired attorney Susan Ellingstad to conduct a separate investigation. Ellingstad is a partner at the firm where attorney Charles Nauen, who represents the DFL, works. DFL Chairman Ken Martin said on Tuesday that the investigation was finished or close to finished and would be released soon. Ellison is also deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee. After the domestic abuse allegation emerged in August, the DNC said it is looking into what happened. \u201cAll allegations of domestic abuse are disturbing and should be taken seriously. We are working with the Minnesota state party to review these allegations,\u201d a DNC spokeswoman said in a statement Wednesday morning, declining to comment further. The Democratic Party\u2019s choice of Ellingstad to conduct the investigation was met with derision from many who said she is not independent, including Donald Trump Jr., who mocked the investigation in a Tweet Wednesday. The firm Ellingstad works for, Lockridge Grindal Nauen, has a political committee that has donated to both Republican and Democratic candidates, including Ellison, according to Federal Election Commission filings. The contributions to Democrats outweigh the Republicans by a margin of about four to one. As we previously reported: Rep. Keith Ellison, who is currently running for attorney general of Minnesota, is being accused of domestic violence against his former partner Karen Monahan. Austin Monahan, Karen Monahan\u2019s son, aired the allegations in a Facebook post Saturday night. According to Austin Monahan, Ellison put his mother through \u201cpure hell.\u201d In the Facebook post, he claims to have seen a video of Ellison dragging Karen Monahan off the bed by her feet while screaming expletives at her. The alleged incident is just one of several, Austin Monahan warned. State Rep. Debra Hilstrom (D-Brooklyn Center) was quick to voice her concern over the accusations, calling on Ellison to \u201canswer these allegations.\u201d DFL-endorsed candidate for attorney general of Minnesota Matt Pelikan also reacted to the story, calling the allegations \u201cextremely troubling.\u201d Karen Monahan has also hinted at the alleged abuse on Twitter, telling Ellison that her \u201ckids, job, health, finances, humanity was deeply impacted by the abuse you are well aware of.\u201d Karen Monahan claims she has videos, recordings, and messages to prove her story. Ellison has admitted the relationship, but is denying the abuse. And the relationship was clearly real. Karen Monahan, an organizer with the Sierra Club, was in a relationship with Ellison for years. The two are seen together in many of her social media posts, including hiking in together national parks and posing with the Obamas at the White House. Records show she lived in his Minneapolis home before their relationship ended. Ellison, who was previously married to a different woman, is divorced. It's hard to know what really happened in a relationship. And the media has kept it quiet. \"Keith Ellison flatly denies allegation that he abused an ex girlfriend. The story had been circulating in MN, and not held up under media scrutiny, so no stories ran. It blew up last night after the ex\u2019s son posted the allegation on Facebook.\" Dave Weigel. It's not quite the first time for Keith X. This is not the first time Ellison has faced misconduct allegations. In 2006, a woman named Amy Alexandar claimed that Ellison ostracized her and smeared her name after having an extramarital affair with her in the 1990s and then again in the 2000s. Ellison in 2005 filed a restraining order against her after what he described as phone and email harassment. She subsequently tried to get a restraining order against him, which a judge denied, ordering her to stop repeating allegations of an affair or intimidation. Ellison subsequently agreed to dismiss his restraining order against her if she no longer contacted him. I'm not sure that this is nothing more than damage control just before the elections. Ellison won the primary days after the allegations were made public. Of course, accusations does not make one guilty for Ellison anymore than they do for Judge Kavanaugh. However, at least in the case of Ellison, at least one of the women were not scared about their reputation and had any political motive to call the police and file a report. When it comes to Ellison though, we know he is an effeminate pansy\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

Apparently, the US didn't learn from its first dealings in regime change decades ago and is now prepared to give it another shot, according to leaked documents. Don't get me wrong here. I'm not for the government of Iran. I despise Islam and I despise the ideology of Muhammad and his devout followers. Overall, the people of Iran are probably some decent people, but those in leadership have issues, but that is something for the people there to deal with. Iran is not an actual threat to the united States. However, the US seems hell-bent on continuing to put its nose into other countries politics, including seeking to change its government while hypocritically pointing at other countries for trying to manipulate our own political system. take our poll - story continues below Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?

The Washington Free Beacon reports: The Trump administration is examining a new plan to help Iranians fighting the hardline regime in Iran following America's exit from the landmark nuclear deal and reimposition of harsh economic sanctions that could topple a regime already beset by protests and a crashing economy, according to a copy of the plan obtained by the Washington Free Beacon. The three-page white paper being circulated among National Security Council officials in the White House offers a strategy by which the Trump administration can actively work to assist an already aggravated Iranian public topple the hardline ruling regime through a democratization strategy that focuses on driving a deeper wedge between the Iranian people and the ruling regime. The plan, authored by the Security Studies Group, or SSG, a national security think-tank that has close ties to senior White House national security officials, including National Security Adviser John Bolton, seeks to reshape longstanding American foreign policy toward Iran by emphasizing an explicit policy of regime change, something the Obama administration opposed when popular protests gripped Iran in 2009. The regime change plan seeks to fundamentally shift U.S. policy towards Iran and has found a receptive audience in the Trump administration, which has been moving in this direction since Bolton\u2014a longtime and vocal supporter of regime change\u2014entered the White House. Ah, yes, John Bolton. While I applaud Bolton for his willingness to call Islamic jihadis just that, I am not so naive as to consider that his membership in the Council on Foreign Relations has no effect in this decision. \"The ordinary people of Iran are suffering under economic stagnation, while the regime ships its wealth abroad to fight its expansionist wars and to pad the bank accounts of the Mullahs and the IRGC command,\" SSG writes in the paper. \"This has provoked noteworthy protests across the country in recent months.\" Well, why is that? It's due to sanctions imposed by the likes of the US. As has been pointed out before, sanctions hurt the people, not the governments that lead them and then those same governments use the effects to propagandize the people against those who are ordering the sanctions. I'm not saying the Iranian government is good, but it is Iran's government. Honestly, I see a ton of corruption and warmongering in our own government that rivals some of that of governments that America stands against. Still, as was pointed out by Matt Agorist, Bolton told an audience of the Grand Gathering of Iranians for Free Iran: \u201cThere is a viable opposition to the rule of the ayatollahs, and that opposition is centered in this room today. I had said for over 10 years since coming to these events, that the declared policy of the United States of America should be the overthrow of the mullahs\u2019 regime in Tehran. The behavior and the objectives of the regime are not going to change, and therefore the only solution is to change the regime itself. And that\u2019s why, before 2019, we here will celebrate in Tehran!\u201d And again, this really has nothing to do with the US. One source close to the White House who has previewed the plan told the Free Beacon that the nuclear deal, also known as the JCPOA, solidified the Iranian regime\u2019s grip on power and intentionally prevented the United States from fomenting regime change. \u201cThe JCPOA purposefully destroyed the carefully created global consensus against the Islamic Republic,\u201d said the source, who would only speak to the Free Beacon on background about the sensitive issue. \u201cPrior to that, everyone understood the dangers of playing footsie with the world\u2019s largest state sponsor of terrorism. It\u2019s now Trump, Bolton, and [Mike] Pompeo\u2019s job to put this consensus back in place.\u201d The source told the Beacon that Bolton is \u201cacutely aware of the danger the Iranian regime poses to the region.\u201d \u201cJohn is someone who understands the danger of Iran viscerally, and knows that you\u2019re never going to fundamentally change its behavior\u2014and the threats against Israel and the Saudis especially\u2014until that revolutionary regime is gone,\u201d the source said, adding that \u201cnothing\u2019s off the table right now if Israel is attacked.\u201d OK, I get they may pose a danger, but let's look at the reality here. Those they pose a danger to, namely Saudi Arabia and Israel can both fend perfectly well for themselves and have demonstrated that ability to do it.

Traditionalists are often derided by neo-Catholic commentators for relying on supposedly apocryphal quotations from Popes or saints bearing on the current ecclesial crisis. But these critics never demonstrate that the oft-cited quotations are apocryphal; they merely assert that they must be, as they seem too probative to be true. This is often done in comment boxes or responses to online queries at neo-Catholic websites, wherein the neo-Catholic commentator professes he can find no source for a given quotation\u2014meaning he hasn\u2019t bothered to do any serious investigation beyond a few Google searches. Take this quotation of Pius XII, for example, speaking in 1931 when he was still Monsignor Pacelli, serving as Pius XI\u2019s Secretary of State: I am worried by the Blessed Virgin\u2019s messages to Lucy of Fatima. This persistence of Mary about the dangers which menace the Church is a divine warning against the suicide that would be represented by the alteration of the faith, in her liturgy, her theology and her soul\u2026. I hear all around me innovators who wish to dismantle the Sacred Chapel, destroy the universal flame of the Church, reject her ornaments and make her feel remorse for her historical past. A day will come when the civilized world will deny its God, when the Church will doubt as Peter doubted. She will be tempted to believe that man has become God. In our churches, Christians will search in vain for the red lamp where God awaits them. Like Mary Magdalene, weeping before the empty tomb, they will ask, \u201cWhere have they taken Him?\u201d When I first cited this quotation some 17 years ago, I was contacted by a very prominent neo-Catholic luminary who demanded a source for it, because he and his friends believed it was \u201capocryphal.\u201d I did not receive the courtesy of a thank-you when I pointed him to pp. 52-53 of Msgr. Roche\u2019s biography of Pius XII, Pie XII Devant L\u2019Histoire (Paris: Editions Robert Laffont, 1972), an out-of-print French-language work I managed to obtain after an extensive search of used book seller inventory. The French original text confirms the accuracy of the English translation I had seen before I cited the statement. A Modernist apostate priest, one Emile Poulet, who left the priesthood and married, attempted to cast doubt on the credibility of Msgr. Roche\u2019s account of the words of the future Pius XII. Small wonder: Poulet, who died in 2014 at the age of 94, belonged to the \u201cworker-priest\u201d movement that none other than Pius XII had condemned, as I note here. His attempt to debunk the quotation involved nit-picking about what he claimed were factual errors elsewhere in the Roche biography. But he had no evidence that the quotation as such was a fabrication. He simply wished that it was so. Let\u2019s give our neo-Catholic friends another \u201capocryphal\u201d quotation to dismiss out of hand. This one pertains to an astonishing prophecy by Saint Francis of Assisi about a future occupant of the Chair of Peter: A short time before the holy Father\u2019s [St. Francis\u2019] death, he called together his children and warned them of the coming troubles: \u201cAct bravely, my brethren; take courage and trust in the Lord. The time is fast approaching in which there will be great trials and afflictions; perplexities and dissensions, both spiritual and temporal, will abound; the charity of many will grow cold, and the malice of the wicked will increase. The devils will have unusual power; the immaculate purity of our Order, and of others, will be so much obscured that there will be very few Christians who obey the true Supreme Pontiff and the Roman Church with loyal ears and perfect charity. \u201cAt the time of this tribulation a man, not canonically elected, will be raised to the Pontificate, who, by his cunning, will endeavour to draw many into error and death. Then scandals will be multiplied, our Order will be divided, and many others will be entirely destroyed, because they will consent to error instead of opposing it. \u201cThere will be such diversity of opinions and schisms among the people, the religious and the clergy, that, except those days were shortened, according to the words of the Gospel, even the elect would be led into error, were they not specially guided, amid such great confusion, by the immense mercy of God\u2026. \u201cThose who persevere in their fervor and adhere to virtue with love and zeal for the truth, will suffer injuries and persecutions as rebels and schismatics; for their persecutors, urged on by the evil spirits, will say they are rendering a great service to God by destroying such pestilent men from the face of the earth\u2026 \u201cSome preachers will keep silent about the truth, and others will trample it under foot and deny it. Sanctity of life will be held in derision even by those who outwardly profess it, for in those days Our Lord Jesus Christ will send them, not a true Pastor, but a destroyer.\u201d [paragraph breaks added] This quotation appears in Works of the Seraphic Father, St. Francis of Assisi, published in 1882 by the London-based Catholic publishing house R. Washbourne, 1882, pp. 248-250). It is readily available as a Google book. The same book, it must be noted, contains an appendix setting forth \u201cDoubtful Works of Saint Francis,\u201d of which the quotation is not part. Thus, the publisher itself carefully distinguished the authentic prophecies of Saint Francis from what might be apocryphal. Moreover, in 1882 there could hardly have been any \u201cradical traditionalist\u201d motive to circulate phony quotations of the saint. \"St. Francis in Ecstacy\", Caravaggio, 1595 Saint Francis\u2019 prophecy is clearly not a prediction of the Great Western Schism (1378-1417), which did not involve a \u201cdestroyer\u201d on the Chair of Peter who leads the faithful into error, widespread apostasy, and the persecution of faithful Catholics as \u201cschismatics.\u201d But it does contain elements very familiar to us today.

We are, therefore, reprinting below Frontpage editor Jamie Glazov\u2019s July 12, 2016 Breitbart article, \"9 Steps to Successfully Counter Jihad\". Having written the article in the closing chapter of the disastrous Obama administration, the author recognizes and celebrates the life-saving turn-around disposition that the Trump administration has brought in to counter Jihad. Frontpage is most confident that the suggested steps below will continue to be the overall focus of the new administration -- which, thankfully, is now taking many of the crucial and constructive steps vis-\u00e0-vis our enemy. We find the article more relevant and urgent than ever due to the 17th anniversary of 9/11 approaching tomorrow: 9 Steps to Successfully Counter Jihad. By Jamie Glazov While the Obama administration continues to allow the Muslim Brotherhood to direct American foreign policy and, therefore, to implement \u201cstrategies\u201d that render America defenseless in the face of Jihad and stealth Jihad, there are some alternative strategies that have the potential to turn this catastrophic situation around completely in America\u2019s favor. Below are 9 concrete steps that, if implemented by a future American administration, would make a big difference in preserving our civilization and in defending Americans from terrorism: 1. Label the Enemy and Make a Threat Assessment. The Obama administration continues to refuse to label our enemy and, therefore, it continues to enable our defeat in the terror war. It is urgent that we name our enemy (i.e. Islamic Jihad) and definitively identify what ideology inspires our enemy (i.e. Islamic law). 2. Scrap \u201cCountering Violent Extremism.\u201d \u201cCountering Violent Extremism\u201d is the pathetic and destructive focus of the Obama administration in allegedly fighting the terror war. On the one hand, this \u201cfocus\u201d is vague to the point of being meaningless and completely incapacitates us. On the other hand, this focus allows the administration to perpetuate the destructive fantasy that there are other types of \u201cextremists\u201d \u2014 who just happen to be the Left\u2019s political opponents \u2014 that pose a great threat to the country. For example, as Stephen Coughlin has revealed, the \u201cviolent extremists\u201d the administration is clearly worried about are the \u201cright-wing Islamophobes\u201d whom the administration obviously considers to be the real threat to American security. The \u201cCountering Violent Extremism\u201d is trash and needs to be thrown in the garbage. 3. Stop \u201cPartnering\u201d With Muslim Brotherhood Front Groups. The government needs to stop cooperating with, and listening to, Muslim Brotherhood front groups such as CAIR and ISNA immediately. The Muslim Brotherhood document, the Explanatory Memorandum, has made it clear that the Brotherhood\u2019s objective is to destroy our civilization from within by our own hands with the influence of these groups. Moreover, as Robert Spencer advises, there needs to be legislation that will bar all such groups and affiliated individuals from advising the government or receiving any grants from it. 4. Implement a Concrete \u201cCountering-Jihad\u201d Strategy. After discarding the \u201cCountering Violent Extremism\u201d absurdity, a concrete Counter-Jihad strategy must become an official policy. It must specifically register that Jihadists are the enemies and that Islamic law (Sharia) is what specifically motivates them. Most importantly, as Sebastian Gorka urges in Defeating Jihad: The Winnable War, the government needs to lay down a vision, an actual \u201cthreat doctrine analysis\u201d in a thorough document, just like George Kennan\u2019s Long Telegram and NSC-68 did in laying out the strategic foundation to fighting communism in the Cold War. It is absolutely mind-boggling that nothing of this sort exists today in our terror war \u2014 and it is a reflection of the Left being in charge and of the destructive defeat that it is sowing. 5. Launch Our Own Counter-propaganda Campaign. The Left and Islamists engage in propaganda 24/7. What does our propaganda war entail? Zilch. Sebastian Gorka is crucially correct, therefore, when he recommends a national counter-propaganda campaign that involves a two-part approach: the first being the bolstering of efforts to define our enemy (Steps #1 and #4 above) and, second, the strengthening of our allies and partners in their own counter-propaganda efforts \u2013 which must include our empowering of Muslims who are trying to form an anti-Jihadist version of Islam. Consequently, educational programs have to be set up everywhere, from public schools to universities to workplaces, in businesses and numerous other institutions. These programs must crystallize what exactly Islamic Law is and how it inspires and sanctions violence against unbelievers. This has to also involve, as Gorka urges, \u201ca nationwide program of education that includes the armed services as well as federal, state, and local police forces and the intelligence community.\u201d The education campaign must also focus on the second part of Gorka\u2019s counter-propaganda campaign, which is to help strengthen Muslims who seek to seize Islam from the jihadists\u2019 hands. 6. Affirm Sharia\u2019s Assault on the U.S. Constitution as Seditious. Once the truth is accepted that jihadis are inspired and sanctioned by their Islamic texts, it must logically become required that mosques, Islamic schools and groups have to immediately curtail any teaching that motivates sedition, violence, and hatred of unbelievers (i.e. remember how CAIR advised Muslims not to talk to the FBI). Indeed, once the government discerns and labels the elements of Islamic law that threaten the American Constitution, any preaching and spreading of those elements in America must be labelled as seditious. 7.

But this ridiculous exercise in virtue-signaling, even though it has not (yet) been taken up by the Home Office, only highlights Britain\u2019s hypocrisy and double standards regarding who can enter the country and who cannot. Pamela Geller and I are banned from entering the country for the crime of telling the truth about Islam and jihad. Meanwhile, Britain has a steadily lengthening record of admitting jihad preachers without a moment of hesitation. Syed Muzaffar Shah Qadri\u2019s preaching of hatred and jihad violence was so hardline that he was banned from preaching in Pakistan, but the UK Home Office welcomed him into Britain. The UK Home Office also admitted Shaykh Hamza Sodagar into the country, despite the fact that he has said: \u201cIf there\u2019s homosexual men, the punishment is one of five things. One \u2013 the easiest one maybe \u2013 chop their head off, that\u2019s the easiest. Second \u2013 burn them to death. Third \u2013 throw \u2019em off a cliff. Fourth \u2013 tear down a wall on them so they die under that. Fifth \u2013 a combination of the above.\u201d Theresa May\u2019s relentlessly appeasement-minded government also admitted two jihad preachers who had praised the murderer of a foe of Pakistan\u2019s blasphemy laws. One of them was welcomed by the Archbishop of Canterbury. Meanwhile, the UK banned three bishops from areas of Iraq and Syria where Christians are persecuted from entering the country. \u201cLondon: Muslim Enclave Votes to \u2018Ban Trump,\u2019\u201d by Liam Deacon, Breitbart, January 20, 2018: A London borough \u2013 which has the highest percentage of Muslims in the UK \u2013 has voted to ban U.S. President Donald J. Trump for the area, declaring him a \u201cbigot\u201d. The council has been at the centre of serious corruption scandals, including the removal of an Islamist mayor who was found guilty of bribing Muslim groups and wielding \u201cundue spiritual influence\u201d on Muslim voters. The anti-Trump motion, proposed by Councillor Ohid Ahmed and Councillor Oliur Rahman, passed by a majority vote this week. It calls for President Trump\u2019s planned state visit to the United Kingdom to be cancelled, adding: \u201cShould the Government still choose to go ahead with State Visit, this Council makes clear that President Trump would not be welcome in our Borough.\u201d The area in East London includes the famous Tower Bridge and Canary Wharf, but the ban does not appear to be enforceable. The current Labour mayor, John Biggs, complained that President Trump \u201cdoesn\u2019t applaud diversity [and] doesn\u2019t respect the culture of others and doesn\u2019t respect women\u201d. The mayor added: \u201cHe is failing in his leadership and we should not welcome him here. We must be vigorous in our intolerance of his intolerance.\u201d In response to the news, Peter Golds, the leader of the Conservatives group in the council, tweeted: \u201cIn 2015 one of the Tower Hamlets First election candidates tweeted \u2018let us support Hitler the Great.\u2019 These people, corruptly elected, have no shame. For the record, our group refused to vote in this farce.\u201d \u201cTower Hamlets is home to one of the country\u2019s most diverse communities,\u201d the motion begins, adding that it \u201chas the highest percentage of Muslim residents in England \u2013 35 per cent compared with the national average of 5 per cent\u201d. After several paragraphs of platitudes about \u201ccommunity cohesion\u201d and \u201cdiversity\u201d, it says \u201cthis Council notes with shock and alarm the decision by Donald Trump, President of the United States, to \u2018retweet\u2019 Islamophobic propaganda from the Britain First Twitter account\u201d. It also bemoans that he has allegedly \u201cbigoted attitude towards women, ethnic minorities and Muslims which has resulted in examples of division and hatred within the USA and beyond\u201d and attacks his \u201cillogical\u201d decision to move the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.

            "question": "Which of the following tactics is used in the following text?\n\nArticle: Archbishop Vigan\u00f2 Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic In his eleven-page account, affirmed under oath, the Archbishop, marking a turning point in Church history, declares that senior Vatican officials, including former Secretaries of State Angelo Sodano and Tarcisio Bertone as well as Cardinal \u00d3scar Andr\u00e9s Rodr\u00edguez Maradiaga, coordinator of Pope Bergoglio\u2019s \u201cCouncil of Cardinals\u201d, covered up McCarrick\u2019s decades of sexual predation and that Bergoglio himself continued the coverup. This article was first written to address the neo-Catholic commentator Massimo Faggioli\u2019s attempt , following the Pennsylvania grand jury report and the fall of ex-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, to minimize the homosexual crisis in the Church and blunt the correlative rise of what he derides as \u201cneo-traditionalism.\u201d As my piece was about to go to press, however, EWTN\u2019s National Catholic Register broke the explosive story on the written testimony of Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigan\u00f2 , former apostolic nuncio to the United States (2011 to 2016). Faggioli\u2019s propaganda piece now becomes merely illustrative of the points to be made here in light of this astonishing and indeed providential development. Regarding Bergoglio, Vigan\u00f2 testifies that in 2013 he personally informed him about McCarrick\u2019s history, the dossier of the Congregation for Bishops on his sexual crimes against boys and young men, and the disciplinary sanctions imposed upon him by Benedict XVI (forbidding residence in a seminary, public appearances and Masses). Evidently already aware of these facts, however, Bergoglio not only rehabilitated McCarrick but made him a \u201ctrusted counselor\u201d who advised the elevation of the pro-homosexual prelates Blase Cupich, Joseph Tobin and Kevin Farrell to the College of Cardinals and the prominent episcopal sees they now discredit. All of this happened before Bergoglio, bowing to worldwide public pressure, finally\u2014only weeks ago\u2014took decisive action against his \u201ctrusted counselor.\u201d McCarrick had lobbied for Bergoglio\u2019s election, along with Maradiaga and the infamous Cardinal Danneels, who covered up homosexual rape committed by a priest against his own nephew,has supported \u201csame-sex marriage,\u201d and advised the King of Belgium to sign a law legalizing abortion in 1990. As Edward Pentin notes: \u201call 3 prelates have since been special advisors of Francis or rehabilitated by him.\u201d Vigan\u00f2 concludes his testimony by declaring that all of the prelates involved (many others are implicated), including Bergoglio, should resign their offices for the good of the Church. As to Bergoglio in particular, he courageously states openly the truth that so many of his brethren know but fear to speak in public: I want to recall this indefectible truth of the Church\u2019s holiness to the many people who have been so deeply scandalized by the abominable and sacrilegious behavior of the former Archbishop of Washington, Theodore McCarrick; by the grave, disconcerting and sinful conduct of Pope Francis and by the conspiracy of silence of so many pastors, and who are tempted to abandon the Church, disfigured by so many ignominies. At the Angelus on Sunday, August 12, 2018 Pope Francis said these words: \u201cEveryone is guilty for the good he could have done and did not do ... If we do not oppose evil, we tacitly feed it. We need to intervene where evil is spreading; for evil spreads where daring Christians who oppose evil with good are lacking.\u201d [emphasis in original] If this is rightly to be considered a serious moral responsibility for every believer, how much graver is it for the Church\u2019s supreme pastor, who in the case of McCarrick not only did not oppose evil but associated himself in doing evil with someone he knew to be deeply corrupt. He followed the advice of someone he knew well to be a pervert, thus multiplying exponentially with his supreme authority the evil done by McCarrick. And how many other evil pastors is Francis still continuing to prop up in their active destruction of the Church! [my emphasis] Francis is abdicating the mandate which Christ gave to Peter to confirm the brethren. Indeed, by his action he has divided them, led them into error, and encouraged the wolves to continue to tear apart the sheep of Christ\u2019s flock. In this extremely dramatic moment for the universal Church, he must acknowledge his mistakes and, in keeping with the proclaimed principle of zero tolerance, Pope Francis must be the first to set a good example for cardinals and bishops who covered up McCarrick\u2019s abuses and resign along with all of them. [emphasis in original] Before he was papal nuncio in Washington, Vigan\u00f2 headed the Governorate of Vatican City State after having served as Nuncio in Nigeria, a Delegate for the Pontifical Representatives of the Secretary of State of the Holy See and a Member of the Disciplinary Commission of the Roman Curia. In those capacities he had access to documents and witnesses that corroborate his own firsthand testimony. With Vigan\u00f2\u2019s testimony, the widespread homosexual infiltration of the post-Vatican II hierarchy, from the top on down, now emerges mountainously into view, never to be buried again. Even before that testimony, however, the fall of McCarrick and the Pennsylvania grand jury report had already presented a Sisyphean task to neo-Catholic apologists for the decrepit Novus Ordo status quo and the ill-starred Council that launched its installation. Yet there is little doubt they will continue the same polemic that for nearly sixty years has doggedly defended every one of the ruinous \u201creforms\u201d that have resulted in a debacle without equal in Church history, even considering the Arian crisis of the 4th century. Those \u201creforms\u201d included abandonment of the Vatican\u2019s strict pre-conciliar instruction (1961) that \u201cadvancement to religious vows and ordination should be barred to those who are afflicted with evil tendencies to homosexuality or pederasty, since for them the common life and the priestly ministry would constitute serious dangers.\u201d Today, neo-Catholic commentators, cowed by the demands of political correctness, refuse to state the simple truth that homosexuality is a perversion that precludes ordination as does any other grave psychological disorder.

The large galaxy is stunning in size and has around three times as many stars as the Milky Way does. It can easily be seen with the naked eye from Earth, and it is found in the constellation of Andromeda, from which its name originates. Far from being just a pretty sight in the sky, the Andromeda Galaxy is an impressive, turbulent patch of the cosmos. It is even expected to collide with the Milky Way years down the road. If you find that fascinating, then you are going to enjoy these ten amazing facts about the Andromeda Galaxy. 10 Also Known As Messier 31 Celestron NexStar 90SL... Buy New $309.95 (as of 04:50 EDT - Details) Our closest neighboring galaxy is also known as Messier 31 or M31. The name came from Charles Messier, the French astronomer who catalogued the large galaxy. Messier documented many objects in the skies of the Northern Hemisphere, and they are collectively known as the Messier objects or the Messier Catalog. (Note that Messier wasn\u2019t always the first to observe the objects in his catalog.) In 1757, he had begun searching for Halley\u2019s Comet, but the calculations given to him had sent him to a different section of the sky. That wrong section of the sky is where he observed a nebula that became the first entry in the catalog: M1, also known as the Crab Nebula. In 1764, Charles Messier added M31 to his catalog. By the end of the year, he had added a total of 38 objects. By 1781, he had logged a total of 103 objects into his catalog, 40 of which had been found by Messier himself.[1] 9 Named After The Andromeda Constellation Photo credit: Keilana, Roberta Mura If you look up into the northern night sky between Cassiopeia\u2019s \u201cW\u201d asterism and the Great Square of Pegasus, you will find the constellation Andromeda. The star pattern was named after the mythical princess Andromeda, the wife of the Greek hero Perseus. The constellation was first cataloged by the Greek astronomer Ptolemy in the second century, and it is also known by the names of Chained Maiden, Persea, or Cepheis.

Andromeda is located outside the galactic plane, and it does not contain any clusters or nebulae of the Milky Way; it does contain other visible galaxies, though. The most famous of these galaxies is, of course, the Andromeda Galaxy, which gets its name from the large constellation. The constellation is best-known for the Andromeda Galaxy, which is one of the most famous objects in the sky that can be seen with the naked eye.[2] 8 Larger Than The Milky Way In astronomy, a light-year is a commonly used unit to measure distance, but some astronomers prefer to use a unit called the parsec. When referring to something larger, they use kiloparsecs, which are equal to 1,000 parsecs, and megaparsecs, equal to one million parsecs. The Milky Way measures about 100,000 light-years or 30 kiloparsecs across. This may seem large, but it is rather small when compared to other galaxies. The Andromeda Galaxy has an approximate diameter of 220,000 light years, which is more than double of that of the Milky Way. It is the largest galaxy in the Local Cluster. If it were bright enough, the Andromeda Galaxy would appear larger than the Moon in the sky (as depicted above), even with it being much farther away. The galaxy is 9.5 trillion kilometers away from Earth, whereas the Moon is only 384,400 kilometers (238,900 mi) away\u2014that should give you a better understanding of just how big the galaxy really is.[3] Read the Whole Article\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

The indoctrination is getting so bad, that some parents are even concerned about liberal violence against those who reject the brainwashing. According to The Washington Times, the recent school shooting at Parkland, Florida, was the last straw for scores of parents. The paper noted that \u201cthe phones started ringing at the Texas Home School Coalition, and they haven\u2019t stopped yet.\u201d \u201cWhen the Parkland shooting happened, our phone calls and emails exploded,\u201d said coalition president Tim Lambert. \u201cIn the last couple of months, our numbers have doubled. We\u2019re dealing with probably between 1,200 and 1,400 calls and emails per month, and prior to that it was 600 to 700.\u201d But according to Natural News, it isn\u2019t just the rampant violence worrying some parents. That\u2019s just the tip of the collectivist agenda iceberg. Christopher Chin, head of Homeschool Louisiana, told The Times that parents are fed up with \u201cthe violence, the bullying, the unsafe environments.\u201d Many parents are also disturbed by the social engineering, which amounts to brainwashing and indoctrination that goes on in a public school. For example, a Minnesota public school is forcing Kindergarten students to study \u2018white privilege\u2019. The left-wing curriculum and common core are also driving parents to remove their children from public schools. Brian D. Ray, who heads up the National Home Education Research Institute, in Salem, Oregon, who\u2019s conducted homeschooling research for 33 years, told The Times that concern over school curriculum has reached the top of the charts for most parents. Ray said the top three reasons that parents choose homeschooling are a desire to provide religious instruction or different values than those offered in public schools; dissatisfaction with the academic curriculum, and worries about the school environment. Since teachers are not allowed to arm themselves to defend their students against the violence often perpetrated at schools simply because they are gun free zones, homeschooling takes care of that problem. \u201cMost parents homeschool for more than one reason,\u201d Ray told the paper. \u201cBut when we ask families why do they homeschool, near the top nowadays is concern about the environment of schools, and that includes safety, pressure to get into drugs, pressure to get into sexual activity. It includes all of that.\u201d Indoctrination means to teach a person to accept a belief uncritically. It\u2019s the very reason the governments of the world still exist. People cannot logically and critically understand that hurting people and taking their things is wrong \u2013 even if people who declare themselves government is the one doing it. Governments are nothing more than a handful of people and have no right to aggress against others. But humans are taught at a young age to never question this and that belief has kept most of humanity enslaved for centuries. It isn\u2019t a surprise that so many have decided to educate their children themselves. And as schools continue to fail, and authoritarian policies continue to wreak havoc on our society, more will wake up to the absolute horror of what allowing the state to educate our children has done to the moral fabric of humanity.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

At the same time, according to military planning documents, the majority of the crowd might dissolve along their long journey to the US. While the US still has very little intel about the composition of the migrant caravans, one way or the other the White House plans to outmatch the number of potential illegals and, if not, suppress them with brutal force.

The US Democratic Party is determined to take the world to thermo-nuclear war rather than to admit that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election fair and square. The Democratic Party was totally corrupted by the Clinton Regime, and now it is totally insane. Leaders of the Democratic Party, such as Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, my former co-author in the New York Times, have responded in a non-Democratic way to the first step President Trump has taken to reduce the extremely dangerous tensions with Russia that the Clinton, George W. Bush, and Obama regimes created between the two superpowers. Yes, Russia is a superpower. Russian weapons are so superior to the junk produced by the waste-filled US military/security complex that lives high off the hog on the insouciant American taxpayer that it is questionable if the US is even a second class military power. If the insane neoconservatives, such as Max Boot, William Kristol, and the rest of the neocon scum get their way, the US, the UK, and Europe will be a radioactive ruin for thousands of years. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi (CA), Minority Leader of the US House of Representatives, declared that out of fear of some undefined retribution from Putin, a dossier on Trump perhaps, the President of the United States sold out the American people to Russia because he wants to make peace: \u201cIt begs the question, what does Vladimir Putin, what do the Russians have on Donald Trump\u2014personally, politically and financially that he should behave in such a manner?\u201d The \u201csuch a manner\u201d Pelosi is speaking about is making peace instead of war. The Tyranny of Good In... Paul Craig Roberts, La... Best Price: $5.64 Buy New $5.00 (as of 10:35 EDT - Details) To be clear, the Democratic Minority Leader of the US House of Representatives has accused Donald Trump of high treason against the United States. There is no outcry against this blatantly false accusation, totally devoid of evidence. The presstitute media instead of protesting this attempt at a coup against the President of the United States, trumpet the accusation as self-evident truth. Trump is a traitor because he wants peace with Russia. Here is Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer (NY) repeating Pelosi\u2019s false accusation: \u201cMillions of Americans will continue to wonder if the only possible explanation for this dangerous behavior is the possibility that President Putin holds damaging information over President Trump.\u201d If you don\u2019t believe that this is orchestrated between Pelosi and Schumer, you are stupid beyond belief. Here is disgraced Obama CIA director John Brennan, a leader of the fake Russiagate campaign against President Trump in order to prevent Trump from making peace with Russia and, thus, by making the world safer, threatening the massive, unjustified budget of the military/security complex: \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s press conference performance in Helsinki rises to and exceeds the threshold of high crimes and misdemeanors. It was nothing short of treasonous. Not only were Trump\u2019s comments imbecilic, he is wholly in the pocket of Putin. Republican Patriots: Where are you???\u201d Here are many more. And here is more from the CIA bought-and-paid-for BBC. NOTICE THAT NOT ONE WESTERN MEDIA SOURCE IS CELEBRATING AND THANKING TRUMP AND PUTIN FOR EASING THE ARTIFICAILLY CREATED TENSIONS THAT WERE LEADING TO NUCLEAR WAR. HOW CAN THIS BE? HOW CAN IT BE THAT THE WESTERN MEDIA IS SO OPPOSED TO PEACE? WHAT IS THE EXPLANATION? The Russians, the Chinese, the Iranians, and the North Koreans, as well as the rest of the world, desperately need to notice the extremely hostile reaction to peace on the part of the US Democratic Party, many members of the Republican Party, including the despicable US Republican Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham, and the Western Presstitute Media, a collection of people on the CIA payroll according to the German newspaper editor, Udo Ulfkotte, and the CIA itself. Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, John McCain, Lindsey Graham, and the rest of the corrupt filth that rules over us are all in the pay of the military/security complex. Just go and investigate the donations to their re-election campaigns. The 1,000 billion dollar budget of the military/security complex, amplified by the CIA\u2019s front corporations and narcotics business, provides enormous sums with which to purchase the senators and representatives that the insouciant American voters think that they elect. Do you know how large 1,000 billion is? You would have to live for thousands of years and do nothing for 24/7 except count to reach that figure. It is a sum that nurtures the recipients, and the recipients regard it as worth protecting. Therefore, the American public gets not representation, but lies that justify war and conflict. The military/security complex, about which President Eisenhower warned the American people to no effect, is in desperate need of an enemy. In obedience to the military/security complex, the Clinton, George W. Bush, and Obama regimes have made Russia that enemy. If Trump and Putin do not understand this, they will easily be made irrelevant. They both can be assassinated, and that is what the statements from Pelosi, Schumer, McCain, Lindsey Graham, et. al., repeated endlessly in the propaganda ministry that is the Western press, encourages. Trump can be assassinated or overthrown in a political coup for selling out America to Russia, as members of both political parties claim and as the media trumpets endlessly. Putin can be easily assassinated by the CIA operatives that the Russian government stupidly permits to operate throughout Russia in NGOs and Western/US owned media and among the Atlanticist Integrationists, Washington\u2019s Firth Column inside Russia serving Washington\u2019s purposes.

The man, a former Marine who called himself Rick, says he was Paddock\u2019s neighbor between December 2015 and June 2016 in Mesquite, Nevada. \u201cI can tell you 100% this is not that kind of guy,\u201d said Rick, adding that he would see Paddock every other day and that the two would go to a local bar and play slot machines. \u201cHe never even told me that he owned a gun,\u201d continued the shooter\u2019s neighbor, adding that Paddock did not express any religious or political opinions during their conversations. \u201cI\u2019m not a big conspiracy theory guy, but it don\u2019t sit right,\u201d said Rick, before making the extraordinary claim that the whole shooting was a \u201cset up\u201d and that Paddock\u2019s body may have been left in the hotel room while other assailants carried out the shooting. The caller mentioned how some people in the crowd were warned 45 minutes before the shooting that they were going to die, suggesting that this was evidence of a wider plot and not a \u201clone wolf\u201d attack. As a firearms expert, he also questioned the lack of flashes coming from the hotel windows where the shooter was supposedly firing from. Rick said he had already contacted the Clark County Sheriff\u2019s Office to relay all the information he knew. Although the claims are intriguing, it is important to remember that after virtually every terror attack and mass shooting, friends and neighbors express shock that the culprit would be capable of carrying out such horrors, with some outright denying it to be possible. If Paddock was planning such a sophisticated operation and hoping to evade detection, he would not be blabbing details about it to his neighbors. However, the neighbor\u2019s claims are certain to attract more attention given that no specific motive has yet to be uncovered for the shooting. What do you think? Let us know in the comments below.

That means they didn\u2019t find an ISIS membership card in his wallet, or lots of phone calls to Iraq or Syria, or a note from Kazi reading, \u201cI did this for Allah and Islam. Allahu akbar.\u201d Of course, even if they had found those things, given their track record of denial and deception, they may still be searching for Kazi\u2019s motive. In any case, a larger point is being lost here. And that is that there is a war going on. We know that the Islamic State, al-Qaeda and other groups have called upon Muslims in the U.S. to try to kill military personnel and police, as well as civilians. We know that Kazi, with all the propane and gas tanks in his car, was clearly trying to set off a major fire that would kill more people than just himself. Even if he wasn\u2019t on the phone to Baghdadi, the likelihood is that when a Muslim drives into a U.S. Air Force Base with a car full of incendiaries, probably this has something to do with the global jihad. The FBI\u2019s bafflement here is part of its deep, deep corruption. The FBI doesn\u2019t acknowledge that there is a global jihad, or that Islam has anything to do with terrorism. It doesn\u2019t admit that there is a war going on, and treats each act of Islamic terror as if it were a separate and discrete criminal event, unrelated to all the others. So, each time something like this happens, they\u2019re back at Square One, trying to figure out motive. It\u2019s as if the U.S. Army stopped to interrogate every German soldier who crashed through the Ardennes Forest at the beginning of the Battle of the Bulge in 1944, to see if each one\u2019s actions had anything to do with the German Army and Adolf Hitler\u2019s war aims. This willful ignorance leads to a diversion and waste of resources that is astronomical and catastrophic. \u201cMotive a mystery in car explosion at Travis Air Force Base,\u201d by Phil Willon, Los Angeles Times, March 23, 2018: Federal investigators on Friday said that the person who drove a burning minivan filled with propane and gas tanks into the front gate of Travis Air Force Base in Northern California was a 51-year-old Bay Area man originally from India. Hafiz Kazi was a legal permanent resident and had lived in the United States since 1993, said Sean Ragan, FBI special agent in charge of the Sacramento field office. Kazi had lived in the Bay Area, including Sausalito, Ragan said, but his most recent place of residence was not known. Investigators have yet to determine a motive for the Wednesday night attack or evidence that anyone else was involved. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any nexus of terrorism at this point,\u201d Ragan said, adding that aspect of the case was still being investigated. \u201cNow the question is, why. Why was he there? What led him there? And we don\u2019t know answers to that, quite frankly.\u201d Kazi drove the Kia minivan through the front gate of the military base, which is near Fairfield, around 7 p.m. Wednesday. Security personnel saw flames inside the van, which crashed shortly after going through the gate, Ragan said. Emergency responders initially did not know if it was an attack or some sort of mishap. But when they opened the doors to the minivan they found five propane tanks, three plastic one-gallon gas cans, several lighters, three phones and a gym bag with personal items, Ragan said\u2026. The dead man\u2019s religious beliefs and affiliation are not known at this point, said Ragan, who debunked a rumor that some sort of \u201cjihad\u201d video was found on Kazi\u2019s phone\u2026.

From the playground to geopolitics, appeasing an aggressor invites only more aggression. This timeless truth of human nature is one that we moderns can\u2019t seem to accept. We reflexively assume that a rational accommodation or concessions will be reciprocated by those proven to be ready to use any means necessary to achieve their aims, no matter how amoral, unfair, or vicious. Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation hearings for the Supreme Court illustrate that this false assumption leads only to more demands, and ultimately to defeat. The last-minute accusations from Christine Blasey Ford, a woman who claims that decades ago Kavanaugh groped her at a high school party, and Deborah Ramirez, who accused Kavanaugh of exposing himself to her at a frat party at Yale, are transparent acts of aggression against the judge and Republicans, one engineered by the Democrats. Senator Dianne Feinstein sat for months on Ford\u2019s letter and then\u2013\u2013just as the Dems did in 1991with Anita Hill\u2019s charges of sexual harassment against Clarence Thomas\u2019s during his hearings\u2013\u2013released it only when Kavanaugh appeared to be heading for confirmation. Feinstein still hasn\u2019t given the Judiciary Committee an unredacted copy of the letter. A few weeks after Ford went public, and after Kavanaugh said he had dairies from that summer detailing his whereabouts, The New Yorker published Ramirez\u2019s account of a drunken party filled with obscene drinking games where he exposed himself to Ramirez. Given that the Democrats had made public in advance their intention to derail the hearings and confirmation by any means possible, the timing of both sexual assault charges reeks of premeditated contrivance intended to delay confirmation as long as possible. But in the face of this naked ploy to bork Kavanaugh and derail the confirmation process for partisan advantage, the Republicans seem to be reverting to their customary preemptive cringe. All the Dems have to do is squeal \u201csexism\u201d and Republicans start negotiating and offering concessions. Of course, after each concession comes another demand. First the Dems demanded that Ford, a long-time Democrat activist, \u201cbe heard.\u201d So last week the Chairman of Judiciary Committee, Chuck Grassley, granted another deadline extension for Ford to decide whether to testify before the Committee on Monday. Senator Dianne Feinstein calls these concessions \u201cbullying deadlines.\u201d As Feinstein put it, \u201cShow some heart. Wait until Dr. Ford feels that she can come before the committee.\u201d Ford doesn\u2019t \u201cfeel\u201d like she can testify on Monday because she\u2019s afraid of flying, despite offers from the Committee to travel to her in California. Then she feared for her life because of death threats \u2013\u2013threats also made to Kavanaugh, his wife and two young daughters\u2013\u2013 so she now demands enhanced security measures. The Committee caved and moved the date to Thursday. So of course, Grassley having been intimidated into giving Ford a chance to address the Committee, Ramirez and her handlers are now demanding the same privilege. \u201cCreepy Lawyer\u201d for porn star Stormy Daniels claims to represent a woman who also should be allowed to testify to the Senate Committee about Kavanaugh\u2019s partying habits while at Yale. We\u2019ll have to see whether Grassley can find the stomach to put an end to the farce of allowing unsubstantiated charges from Democrat activists to waste the Committee\u2019s time. Ford and Dianne Feinstein also keep demanding an FBI investigation, even though no federal crime is being alleged, and any investigation 36 years after the offense is impossible. Ford can\u2019t remember where and when the alleged assault took place, nor how she got to or went home from the party where it allegedly occurred. Her own details of the event don\u2019t jibe (Four boys or three? One girl or two?). She told no one about the assault until 30 years later. A \u201clifelong friend\u201d whom Ford claims was at the party has denied any knowledge of the it, and says she\u2019s never met Kavanaugh. Another friend who reported that the school was abuzz with gossip about the attack (which apparently took place during summer break), retracted her statement. The two men Ford named as possible witnesses to the assault have contradicter her claims under oath. And the accused Judge Kavanaugh also under oath vehemently denies the charges. Given that 36 years have passed since the incident, and the accuser\u2019s memory is so hazy and short on coherent details, the FBI has nothing to investigate. Ramirez\u2019s charge is even flimsier. Here\u2019s a catalogue from the Daily Wire: 1. The New Yorker could not find a single witness who could put Kavanaugh at the alleged party. 2. The New York Times could not find a single person who could corroborate Ramirez\u2019s claims. 3. The man accused of egging on Kavanaugh denied Ramirez's allegations and vouched for Kavanaugh\u2019s character. 4. A third person that Ramirez claimed was at the party says she was not there for the alleged incident. 5. Ramirez contacted her former classmates, asking about the incident, and admitted she was not sure that Kavanaugh was the male who exposed himself. 6. A woman who claims she was \u201cbest friends\u201d with Ramirez says Ramirez never mentioned the story and initially said her friend's accusations against Kavanaugh might be \u201cpolitically motivated.\u201d 7. Ramirez, just like Christine Blasey Ford, is a registered Democrat and is dedicated to leftist causes. 8. Ramirez wasn\u2019t even sure her memory was correct \u2014 until she spent six days going over it with her Democrat lawyer. 9. Ramirez admits there are holes in her memory due to how much she drank at the party. 10. People who knew Ramirez after her time at Yale say that she never once mentioned the incident \u2014 until Kavanaugh's nomination was pending. No law enforcement agency, let alone the FBI, would waste its time with an allegation of a crime decades in the past, and so patently incoherent and lacking in evidence.

But even before the hurricane, housing in the U.S. territory\u2014where 43.5 percent of people live below the poverty line\u2014was in crisis, and many homes on the island were built with salvaged fixtures and without permits, insurance or inspections. Government officials say about half of the housing in Puerto Rico was built illegally and without a permit, The Miami Herald reported Wednesday, which could amount to as many as 1 million homes. Puerto Rico's housing secretary, Fernando Gil, says the number of homes destroyed by the hurricane totals about 70,000 so far, and homes with major damage have amounted to 250,000 across the island. RICARDO ARDUENGO/AFP/Getty Images After 2011, the territory adopted a uniform building code that required structures to be built to withstand winds of up to 140 miles per hour. According to the National Weather Service, Hurricane Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico with winds up to 155 mph. Many buildings on the island were built under a prior code demanding protection against 125-mph winds. Furthermore, numerous homes have been built without any sort of permit at all. \"It\u2019s definitely a housing crisis,\" Gil told Reuters last week. \"It was already out there before, and the hurricane exacerbates it.\" One resident of Puerto Rico's Ca\u00f1o Mart\u00edn Pe\u00f1a neighborhood, Gladys Pe\u00f1a, told the Herald that her home was built by people in her neighborhood and that fixtures for the dwelling were gathered from abandoned structures. \"The one who designed it was me,\" she said. Florida Governor Rick Scott's office estimated that over 318,000 evacuees arrived in the state in the wake of the hurricane, and Federal Emergency Management Agency aid for Puerto Ricans living in Florida hotels will start to expire Friday.

And sometimes, the sexual advances from members of Congress or senior aides are reciprocated in the hopes of advancing one\u2019s career \u2014 what one political veteran bluntly referred to as a \u201csex trade on Capitol Hill.\u201d The American people are not going to put up with this any longer. We have no choice but to clean up our government because the rest of the world is laughing at us. On Tuesday, U.S. Representative Jackie Speier told a congressional hearing that she personally knows of two current members of Congress that have \u201cengaged in sexual harassment\u201d\u2026 \u201cIn fact there are two members of Congress, Republican and Democrat, right now, who serve \u2014 who have\u2026engaged in sexual harassment.\u201d Speier said one of the harassers has propositioned women with the comment, \u201cAre you going to be a good girl?\u201d Another has exposed his genitals, she said, and some victims have had \u201ctheir private parts grabbed on the House floor.\u201d \u201cAll they ask in return as staff members is to be able to work in a hostile-free work environment. They want the system fixed and the perpetrators held accountable.\u201d And Speier was the one that revealed the fact that 15 million dollars have been paid out to victims of sexual harassment in the House in recent years. The following comes from Breitbart\u2026 Rep. Jackie Speier (D-CA) told MSNBC\u2019s Chuck Todd on Meet the Press Daily on Tuesday that the U.S. House of Representatives has paid $15 million to alleged victims of sexual harassment by its own members in recent years. \u201cWe do know there is about $15 million that has been paid out by the House on behalf of harassers in the last ten to 15 years,\u201d she said. \u201c15 million dollars has been paid out over sexual harassment claims,\u201d Todd replied, somewhat shocked. \u201cSo, obviously more than one member of Congress.\u201d If members of Congress are engaged in this type of behavior, why don\u2019t the American people know about it? And why are those members of Congress still allowed to serve? Representative Barbara Comstock also testified on Tuesday. She said that one current member of Congress exposed his private parts to a female staffer when she delivered papers to his house\u2026 Rep. Barbara Comstock (R-Va.) said at a House Administration Committee hearing on Tuesday that a sitting member of the U.S. Congress exposed himself to a young female staffer who delivered papers to his house\u2013at his request. We need to be told who this member of Congress is so that he can be removed from Congress immediately. This kind of behavior is not acceptable for anyone in a civilized society \u2013 and that goes double for someone that is supposed to be one of the leaders of our nation. Here are the exact words that Comstock used as she described this incident\u2026 This member asked a staffer to bring them over some materials, to their residence. And the young staffer \u2014 it was a young woman \u2014 went there and was greeted with a member in a towel. It was a male, who then invited her in. And at that point, he decided to expose himself. She left, and then she quit her job. She left, she found another job. Of course, this sort of behavior is not just limited to members of Congress. According to an ex-Secret Service agent, Vice-President Joe Biden was regularly engaged in \u201cWeinstein-level\u201d predatory behavior\u2026 An ex-Secret Service agent is claiming that former Vice President Joe Biden engaged in \u201cWeinstein-level\u201d sexual assault and that he would walk around the VP residence late at night completely naked. According to Big League Politics\u2019 Cassandra Fairbanks, a Secret Service agent who spoke on condition of anonymity revealed that Biden \u201cwould mess with every single woman or teen,\u201d and that a Christmas get-together at the VP\u2019s house had to be canceled \u201cbecause Biden would grope all of our wives and girlfriend\u2019s asses.\u201d In fact, things were so bad that at one point a Secret Service agent almost got into a fight with Biden. Here is more from Paul Joseph Watson\u2026 During one alleged incident in 2009, Biden cupped the breast of a Secret Service agent\u2019s girlfriend during a photo, prompting the agent to shove Biden and almost hit him. The agent was subsequently suspended for a week, according to the source. Men would often stand in front of female agents and Navy women or create false pretenses to have them leave the room just to get\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

During this operation, ERO deportation officers made arrests in the following Texas cities and towns: Austin (45), San Antonio (41), Rio Grande Valley (37), Laredo (15) and Waco (7). Of the 145 arrested, 86 had criminal convictions; 39 were arrested based on previous immigration encounters, four of which have pending criminal charges; 20 had no prior immigration history or encounters, one has pending criminal charges. Of the total arrests 135 were men and 10 were women. They range in age from 18 to 62 years old. Aliens arrested during this operation are from the following countries: Mexico (128), Guatemala (7), El Salvador (1), Honduras (7), Peru (1) and Jordan (1). Most of the aliens targeted by ERO deportation officers during this operation had prior criminal histories that included convictions for the following crimes: indecency with a child, assault, deadly conduct, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, drug possession, drug trafficking, burglary, resisting arrest, firearms offense, alien smuggling, illegally entering the U.S., and driving under the influence (DUI). Sixty one of those arrested illegally re-entered the United States after having been previously deported, which is a felony. Depending on an alien\u2019s criminality, an alien who re-enters the United States after having been previously deported commits a felony punishable by up to 20 years in federal prison, if convicted. Following are criminal summaries of three offenders arrested during this operation: Feb. 14 \u2013 A previously deported 42-year-old illegal alien from Mexico was arrested in Harlingen, Texas. He was convicted in 2011 of indecency with a child, a felony, and was sentenced to 10 years\u2019 probation. He is currently facing federal criminal charges for illegally re-entering the United States after having been deported. He remains in U.S. Marshals custody pending the outcome of his criminal case. Feb. 15 \u2013 A 42- year-old illegal alien from Mexico was arrested in San Antonio. He was convicted in 2008 for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and sentenced to four months in federal prison. In October 2017, he was convicted for DUI and sentenced to 15 months in prison. He is currently in ICE custody pending removal. Feb. 13 \u2013 A previously deported 40-year-old illegal alien from Mexico was arrested in San Antonio. He was previously removed to Mexico in 2009 after he illegally entered the United States through Laredo, Texas. Sometime after 2009, he illegally re-entered the United States and was arrested at his residence where officers discovered six handguns in his possession. He is being prosecuted for re-entry after deportation, and illegal alien possessing a firearm. He remains in U.S. Marshals custody pending the outcome of his criminal case. \u201cThe results of this operation are a clear indication of ICE\u2019s commitment regarding the role we play in keeping our communities safe by locating, arresting and ultimately removing at-large criminal aliens who pose a threat to public safety, and other immigration fugitives,\u201d said Daniel Bible, field office director for ERO in San Antonio. \u201cICE\u2019s leadership has made clear that ICE will no longer exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement. All of those in violation of the immigration laws may be subject to immigration arrest, detention and \u2013 if found removable by final order \u2013 removal from the United States. By effecting these immigration enforcement operations, the dedicated men and women of ICE help keep our communities safe.\u201d All of the targets in this operation were amenable to arrest and removal under the U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act. ICE deportation officers carry out targeted enforcement operations daily nationwide as part of the agency\u2019s ongoing efforts to protect the nation, uphold public safety, and protect the integrity of our immigration laws and border controls. During targeted enforcement operations, ICE officers frequently encounter other aliens illegally present in the United States. These aliens are evaluated on a case-by-case basis, and, when appropriate, they are arrested by ICE officers.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

Dallas, TX \u2014 In a repugnant and outright disrespectful move, Texas Senator Ted Cruz went to bat for Amber Guyger, the cop who admitted to taking the life of the innocent 26-year-old pillar of society, Botham Jean. During an interview over the weekend, Cruz sat down with FOX 26 who started with the question of what he thought about the tragic killing of Jean by Guyger. FOX 26 asked Cruz to respond to his Democratic midterm rival, Beto O\u2019Rourke, who called for officer Guyger to be fired. \u201cI think we are all counting on the district attorney, on those in positions of trust and power right now, to do the right thing,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said, implying that, at the very minimum, Amber Guyger should be fired. \u201cThere has to be a full accounting for how young black men continue to be killed in this country without accountability, without justice, without these full investigations, without respecting their civil rights. This cannot continue.\u201d take our poll - story continues below Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.? Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?

In response, Cruz lashed out at O\u2019Rourke, claiming that he is being too quick to judge. \u201cI wish Beto O\u2019Rourke & Democrats weren\u2019t so quick to always blame the police officer,\u201d Cruz said Saturday during an interview with Houston\u2019s KRIV. \u201cShe may have been in the wrong \u2026 but I don\u2019t think we should jump to conclusions.\u201d Cruz responds to O'Rourke support for DPD firing Amber Guyger: \"I wish Beto O\u2019Rourke & Democrats weren\u2019t so quick to always blame the police officer. ... She may have been in the wrong ... but I don\u2019t think we should jump to conclusions\" amid investigation https://t.co/68nHBodrOM \u2014 Patrick Svitek (@PatrickSvitek) September 17, 2018 Cruz then went on to call the situation a tragedy and said that if a jury of her peers finds she did something wrong then Guyger should suffer the consequences. To be clear, Amber Guyger admitted to doing something wrong. While controversy swarms the case of why she may have killed Jean, there is no doubt that she did kill him. This is a fact. This public servant walked into an innocent man\u2019s home and shot him dead. Because of her actions, this man no longer lives. That, Senator Ted Cruz, is wrong. Mistake or not, she killed an innocent man. She is the only one to blame and yet she is still collecting a paycheck from taxpayers. Calling for Gugyer to be fired is not the same as calling for people to be fired for making stupid Instagram posts or saying stupid things\u2014she killed an innocent man. At the very least, she should be fired from her job which gave her the gun to do it. What Ted Cruz is doing is the same thing the police and their apologists are doing. They are treating Guyger differently because she is part of the system. In Cruz\u2019s eyes, Guyger going into an apartment that wasn\u2019t her\u2019s and killing an innocent man was simply a case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time\u2014a tragic mistake that ruined two lives, according to Cruz. But that is not the case at all. Would Ted Cruz and police officers be following this same narrative if the roles were reversed? If it was Botham Jean, a black man, walking into the apartment of Amber Guyger, a white female cop, and killing her\u2014would police and Ted Cruz simply write it off as a tragic accident? Of course, we know the answer to that question and it is a resounding, NO. To shut down the peanut gallery before it begins, this is not some case of Democrat versus Republican or right versus left. This is a case of right versus wrong, and what Amber Guyger did to Botham Jean was wrong. There is no other way around it, \u201cmistake\u201d or not. From the start of this case, law enforcement have set out to protect Guyger because she is part of their blue line. Amber Guyger\u2019s home was never searched while Jean\u2019s apartment was searched that night. The results of the blood test to test for alcohol or drugs in her system were never released, yet police \u2014 on the day his mother buried her son \u2014 claimed they found marijuana in his house. It\u2019s been a smear campaign from the beginning and it is this way by design. Amber Guyger took an innocent person\u2019s life, and because people are so blinded by the badge, she is being portrayed as the victim. To those who attempt to claim there is no bias in this horrifically flawed system, if ever there was a case to prove you wrong\u2014this is it. A tragedy indeed.

Refresh the page for updates. (Tallahassee) Project Veritas Action Fund has released undercover video from Florida gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum\u2019s campaign, revealing his election strategy includes making empty promises to voters. This is the seventh undercover video report Project Veritas has released in a series revealing secrets and lies from political campaigns in 2018. Said James O\u2019Keefe, founder and president of Project Veritas Action: \u201cWhat we found in the Gillum campaign was just what we found in Missouri, Tennessee and Arizona, a candidate lying to the voters he needs to win the election.\u201d Gillum campaign makes promises it knows it can\u2019t keep Featured in this report is a campaign staffer who works on Andrew Gillum\u2019s gubernatorial campaign. Omar Smith, who says he went to college with Gillum, reveals Gillum cannot fulfill his campaign promises even if he wanted to. When asked how Gillum would fund all the programs he says he wants to fund, Smith says Gillum \u201ccan\u2019t,\u201d and when asked if voters are aware that Gillum cannot deliver on his proposed programs, Smith says: SMITH: \u201cThat\u2019s not for them to know\u2026 That\u2019s not for them to know. Remember our saying, modern day fairy tales start with \u2018once I am elected.'\u201d Smith explains that most of Gillum\u2019s campaign promises could never be implemented, and that the Gillum campaign knows this: SMITH: \u201cSo, let\u2019s go back to Mr. Gillum\u2019s platform, right? Raise the corporate tax in Florida from 7 to 11 percent. That will never happen. Raise teacher\u2019s pay to $50,000, that will never happen. Give me another position. Medicare for all, that will never happen. The reason being, the legislature that write the bills is all Republican controlled. Democratic governor, Republican legislature. So, unless the legislature writes a bill, and it got voted on the floor, it cannot pass.\u201d Smith says that \u201cthe rules in Florida are f***ed up\u201d and that Florida is a \u201ccracker state,\u201d explaining that the Florida legislature has to become racially black for Gillum\u2019s agenda to advance. \u201cWhip up\u201d the poor into a \u201cfrenzy in order for them to vote.\u201d Smith says that in order to get voters on board with Gillum\u2019s fairy tale platform, the campaign must \u201cwhip\u201d lower income individuals \u201cinto a frenzy.\u201d SMITH: \u201cYou whip \u2019em up. The poor, the middle income. You have to whip them up into a frenzy in order for them to vote. Once Gillum is in, in another 2 years, other Republican Senators and Legislators will be on the ballot. So, you have to whip up the Andrew Gillum voters again in those counties to vote out the Republican to get a Democratic Legislature in order for his (Gillum) will to be executed.\u201d Smith adds that because not all Democratic voters are the same, that the Gillum campaign needs to appeal to \u201cwhite guilt\u201d to turn out the vote: SMITH: \u201cYou have to appeal to white guilt\u2026 [be]cause that\u2019s what it is.\u201d Smith also explains that the Gillum campaign can\u2019t let voters know what Gillum\u2019s true agenda is before election day: SMITH: \u201c\u2026 We don\u2019t, do we have to let [the voters] know what the agenda is ahead of time? We can\u2019t\u2026 We cannot\u2026 You alienate everybody. Then you get painted like, oh, Gillum is being painted, no. You are a socialist, you are way out of left field\u2026\u201d Gillum is a \u201ccrazy, crazy,\u201d Democrat Smith also explains Gillum\u2019s political worldview, saying that \u201cGillum is a progressive\u2026 He is a part of the crazy crazy crazies.\u201d Cliff Eserman, who works for the Broward County Democratic Party adds that during the Democratic primary, Gillum had to campaign on values he does not really believe: ESERMAN: \u201cIn order to win he had to be\u2026 He\u2019s really left of center. So he was being left, not left of center\u2026 For the primary. Now [in the general] he\u2019s going back to left of center.\u201d Dale Holeness, who is the Broward County Commissioner and also works on Gillum\u2019s campaign, explains Gillum\u2019s gun control views: HOLENESS: \u201cThere ought to be at least a three-day waiting period for everybody and a full background check for everybody\u2026 And we need to- And these automatic guns with sixteen rounds a minute, they ought to not be on the streets either, so that\u2019s his plan.\u201d Adrian Young, who works for the Florida Democratic Party also elaborates on Gillum\u2019s gun control views in the report: YOUNG: \u201c\u2026 I do think he\u2019s not saying specifically like I\u2019m going to ban bump stocks or I\u2019m against ATs, only because he\u2019s running a race right now. I do think he would support anybody doing that stuff, Bill Nelson\u2026 But I don\u2019t think he can say it just [be]cause he\u2019s trying to get the moderates and the gun-toting people in North Florida\u2026\u201d More Elections\u2026 This is the seventh release in a series Project Veritas Action Fund began publishing in October 2018 exposing dishonesty and unethical conduct in elections across the country.

Just a few days after the former NYC mayor and latest member of President Trump\u2019s unexpectedly let it slip that \u201cwe got a president who is tough, who does not listen to the people who are naysayers, and a president who is committed to regime change [in Iran]\u201d, the Washington Free Beacon has obtained a three-page white paper being circulated among National Security Council officials with drafted plans to spark regime change in Iran, following the US exit from the Obama-era nuclear deal and the re-imposition of tough sanctions aimed at toppling the Iranian regime. The plan, authored by the Security Studies Group, or SSG, a national security think-tank that has close ties to senior White House national security officials, including \u2013 who else \u2013 National Security Adviser John Bolton, seeks to reshape longstanding American foreign policy toward Iran by emphasizing an explicit policy of regime change, something the Obama administration opposed when popular protests gripped Iran in 2009, writes the Free Beacon, which obtained a leaked copy of the circulating plans. The regime change plan seeks to fundamentally shift U.S. policy towards Iran and has found a receptive audience in the Trump administration, which has been moving in this direction since Bolton\u2014a longtime and vocal supporter of regime change\u2014entered the White House. It deemphasizes U.S military intervention, instead focusing on a series of moves to embolden an Iranian population that has increasingly grown angry at the ruling regime for its heavy investments in military adventurism across the region. \u2013Free Beacon \u201cThe ordinary people of Iran are suffering under economic stagnation, while the regime ships its wealth abroad to fight its expansionist wars and to pad the bank accounts of the Mullahs and the IRGC command,\u201d SSG writes in the paper. \u201cThis has provoked noteworthy protests across the country in recent months\u201d it further claims as an argument to push a \u201cregime change\u201d policy. For now \u2013 at least \u2013 overthrowing the Iran government, with its extensive and close ties to the Kremlin, is not official US policy; SSG president Jim Hanson told the Free Beacon that the Trump administration does not want to engage in direct military intervention in Iran \u2013 and is instead focusing on other methods of ridding Iran of its \u201chardline ruling regime.\u201d \u201cThe Trump administration has no desire to roll tanks in an effort to directly topple the Iranian regime,\u201d Hanson said. \u201cBut they would be much happier dealing with a post-Mullah government. That is the most likely path to a nuclear weapons-free and less dangerous Iran.\u201d That will likely change, however. One source close to the White House who has previewed the plan told the Free Beacon that the nuclear deal, also known as the JCPOA, solidified the Iranian regime\u2019s grip on power and intentionally prevented the United States from fomenting regime change \u201cThe JCPOA purposefully destroyed the carefully created global consensus against the Islamic Republic,\u201d said the source, who would only speak to the Free Beacon on background about the sensitive issue. \u201cPrior to that, everyone understood the dangers of playing footsie with the world\u2019s largest state sponsor of terrorism. It\u2019s now Trump, Bolton, and [Mike] Pompeo\u2019s job to put this consensus back in place.\u201d The source tells the Beacon that Bolton is \u201cacutely aware of the danger the Iranian regime poses to the region.\u201d \u201cJohn is someone who understands the danger of Iran viscerally, and knows that you\u2019re never going to fundamentally change its behavior\u2014and the threats against Israel and the Saudis especially\u2014until that revolutionary regime is gone,\u201d the source said, adding that \u201cnothing\u2019s off the table right now if Israel is attacked.\u201d That said, Bolton is confident that an Iranian regime change will occur in the next six months: John Bolton \u2013 We Will Be Celebrating in Tehran Before 2019 >You can\u2019t say you weren\u2019t warned pic.twitter.com/F1dvZAVQaF \u2014 Battle Beagle \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7 (@HarmlessYardDog) May 7, 2018 A second source tells The Beacon that the Trump administration recognizes that the \u201cchief impediment to the region is Iran\u2019s tyrannical regime.\u201d \u201cThe problem is not the Iran nuclear deal it\u2019s the Iranian regime,\u201d said the source. \u201cTeam Bolton has spent years creating Plans B, C, and D for dealing with that problem.

(Some Final Thoughts on Joseph Ratzinger) Recently an editor of a \u201cconservative\u201d Catholic magazine asked me if I would be interested in contributing a piece about the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI, five years on. I declined, telling him that I was morally certain that anything I had to say about it would not be in keeping with his editorial policies. It\u2019s been five years, and I\u2019ve noticed that there are a lot fewer people talking about what a \u201ccourageous\u201d act it was to give up the pontificate. The consequences of that act have been so outlandish \u2013 even for people who are mostly OK with Francis \u2013 that very few people are still willing to make polite noises about it. Editor's Note: In a March 11th letter signed by Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI and addressed to Msgr. Dario Vigano, prefect of the Secretariat for Communications, the former pope reportedly offers an impassioned defense of Pope Francis against the claim that he lacks theological and philosophical formation. In no uncertain terms, this letter, bearing Benedict's signature, affirms that \u201cthere is an internal continuity between the two pontificates.\u201d Whether Benedict actually wrote this letter or not, it gives rise to a number of grave questions that need to be answered rather urgently before history closes the book on this commedia diabolica. Our thanks to Remnant columnist, Hilary White, for addressing the most pertinent of these here below. MJM In fact, five years after the resignation of Pope Benedict the Catholic faithful mostly want to know why; why would a pope \u2013 a man with decades of up-close-and-personal experience of the \u201cfilth\u201d in the Curia and throughout the church \u2013 suddenly just decide to quit? Why would he choose to walk away knowing that his task was not completed? At the time and since then, particularly in light of what has been happening, it seems one of the most bizarre aspects of this whole bizarre situation that the reasons offered have been so trivial, so inappropriately, so disproportionately petty. These absurd responses to serious questions of grave import have raised the inescapable suspicion that Benedict simply did not take the papacy as seriously as the rest of us did. We cannot help but wonder if these trivialised responses reveal some deep flaw that we had never suspected before. Could we have been wrong about him? And if so, could we have been this wrong? For reasons, all we heard at the time was, essentially, \u201cI\u2019m tired.\u201d There was some implication that he didn\u2019t feel up to international travel anymore, so couldn\u2019t make it to World Youth Day and similar events. The trivialising of the resignation seemed to go hand in hand with the modern concept of the pope-as-pop-star, something we had thought Benedict was too serious a man, too serious a Catholic, to believe himself. Of all people, we had assumed that Benedict XVI took the papacy seriously. And since then, as all the poisons that had been lurking for fifty years in the NewChurch mud are busily hatching out, many Catholics want to know why we hear nothing from him? This man whom we had believed a \u201cchampion of orthodoxy,\u201d whom we thought we knew. Error, even heresy and blasphemy are pouring daily out of the mouth of his successor, who has, literally, turned the Vatican into a den of thieves, and we hear nothing but the occasional, carefully worded statement on how fine everything is. How content he is with his decision and how happy with his current life. After three years of systematic dismantling of everything he had attempted to do in his pontificate, we got this from an apparently utterly insouciant Ratzinger, addressed to Francis: \u201cYour goodness is my home and the place where I feel safe.\u201d Everyone who had ever read anything he had written were amazed he was capable of producing such maudlin drivel, but the video doesn\u2019t lie: So strange was this new tone that speculation started circulating that he was under some kind of external compulsion, not free to speak his mind. But this is not what we see. There he is, manifestly happy and reading it out loud. \u201cPerhaps it was written for him.\u201d Well, why repeat it then? Why, if he has any qualms, allow himself to be trotted out on such occasions, to read this blatant propaganda? If it is a deception, why participate in it? In fact, all the hopeful commenters on blogs and other social media who keep telling me how much they \u201cmiss\u201d him have failed to respect him in one way; they won\u2019t take him at his word. Some insist that his resignation was under some sort of coercion and so isn\u2019t valid. But we have repeatedly heard from him that he was under no constraint, that he had resigned freely. And indeed, far from being an isolated \u201cprisoner of the Vatican,\u201d Benedict has received many guests all of whom report that, though frail, he appears content and never utters a word of criticism. We have yet to hear any report of any notes begging for rescue hidden under a lunch table placemat. There\u2019s no doubt that this is an extremely strange and frankly fishy situation; something doesn\u2019t add up, it\u2019s true. All the questions have gone ignored, or have received frivolous, jokey responses: Why did you resign? Ratzinger: \u201cI was a bit tired and didn\u2019t feel up to partying with the kids at World Youth Day.\u201d If you\u2019re not pope, why do you still wear the white? Ratzinger: \u201cOh, there wasn\u2019t a black cassock that fit me.\u201d Why do you continue to call yourself Benedict XVI if you are no longer pope? Ratzinger: \u201cWell, I\u2019m an \u2018emeritus,\u2019 you see\u2026\u201d And where did this \u201cemeritus\u201d business come from? Does it have any precedent in Catholic history? What does it mean canonically and doctrinally? Ratzinger: \u201c\u2026\u201d What was all that rubbish from Ganswein about\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

DD, based in Austin, TX, was founded by 25-year-old Cody Wilson in 2013. The company's main product is a \"gun fabricator\" called the Ghost Gunner. With nothing but the Ghost Gunner, an internet connection, and some raw materials, anyone, anywhere can make an unmarked, untraceable gun in their home or garage. The settlement states that 3D printing tutorials are approved \u201cfor public release (i.e. unlimited distribution) in any form.\u201d Wilson created a ruckus in May 2013 when he announced his successful design of a plastic gun. In just two days, 100,000 copies of the handgun blueprint were downloaded from Wilson\u2019s website. take our poll - story continues below Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?

You also agree to this site's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use. The most downloads came from Spain, followed by the U.S., Brazil and Germany. The heavy downloading in Spain, Brazil and Germany likely reflected attempts to evade extremely restrictive handgun regulations in those countries. Within days of the gun file being uploaded, the Obama State Department served Wilson with a letter threatening criminal prosecution for violating federal export controls. Wilson immediately complied with the order, but there was no way to stop further downloading. Within a week of the initial uploading, the file could be downloaded on the Internet from over 4,000 different computers around the world. In 2015, the Second Amendment Foundation (SAF) and DD sued the State Department, arguing that \"sharing instructions on how to make guns with 3D printers counts as constitutionally protected speech. This is an important victory for First Amendment rights.\" The Justice Department\u2019s recent settlement with Wilson is very favorable to him, allowing Wilson to provide the printing instructions \u201cfor public release (meaning unlimited distribution) in any form.\u201d The government also compensated $40,000 of Wilson\u2019s legal costs. While this settlement is a victory for First Amendment rights, it will be difficult, if not impossible, for the government to regulate either the printers or the guns that are made with them. How the government will stop people from obtaining these printers isn\u2019t exactly obvious. Proposals to require background checks, mandatory serial numbers and even a registration process for printers are easily defeated. Even if printers are registered with the government, what is going to stop gangs from stealing them? And the designs for making your own printer have been available on the Internet for years. 3D printers make the already extremely difficult job of controlling access to guns practically impossible. The government is not going to be able to ban guns, and limits on the size of bullet magazines will be even more laughable than before. Many parts of a gun can be made on very inexpensive, plastic 3D printers or even from simple machine tools. It will be even more difficult to impose background checks, which have proven quite useless anyway. The government has been no more effective at stopping criminals from getting guns than at stopping them from obtaining drugs. That isn\u2019t too surprising, as drug gangs are the source of both illegal drugs and guns. This was a tough battle for the plaintiff's, SAF and DD. They lost many lower court rulings. Gun-control advocates believe that the government \"capitulated\" too soon. J. Adam Skaggs, the chief counsel for the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, said the administration \u201ccapitulated in a case it had won at every step of the way. This isn\u2019t a case where the underlying facts of the law changed. The only thing that changed was the administration.\u201d The concept of making guns with 3D printers in an age where just one year can render much technology obsolete shouldn't surprise anyone. Nor should the fact that instructions for gun assembly are easily available for download over the internet. At the click of a mouse, we can summon almost any information we could possibly need including instructions for making a bomb. The ability to build an untraceable, unregistered gun is definitely a game changer. It's difficult to see how \"ghost guns\" could ever be regulated by the government.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

American Worker Displacement, Immigrant Population, Black Unemployment ALL DECLINE! | Articles Forget the Wolff book brouhaha and Trump\u2019s latest DACA dalliance \u2014the real story is outside the Beltway , where real people live and work. December marked the fifth month in a row in which the immigrant working-age population ( legal and illegal declined from the same month of the prior year. Simultaneously, immigrant displacement of American workers fell, also apparently confirming a trend that began in September. And, by the way, black unemployment is at a record low. What started after the 2016 election as a reduction in the rate of increase in the foreign-born population of working age has turned into an outright retreat. This is in dramatic contrast to the last months of the Obama Regime, which saw year-over-year increases in immigrant working-age population far in excess of the estimated 1 million legal immigrants admitted annually, and which I argued meant that an unreported illegal alien surge was underway. According to the Labor Department employment report released last Friday, December there were 77,000 fewer working-age immigrants (legal and illegal) in the country in December 2017 than in December 2016\u2014a decline of 0.18%. This follows year-over-year drops of 138,000 in August, 143,000 in September, and 117,000 in October, and 64,000 in November. Not since the Great Recession has the foreign-born working-age population declined for five consecutive months\u2014but now, in telling contrast, the economy is expanding. This makes the Trump Era immigrant workforce decline especially striking. Note that this is a net figure. The year-over- year reduction in the immigrant working-age population does not mean new immigrants have stopped coming in. About 300,000 immigrants die annually, and an equal number leave (voluntarily or otherwise), according to a study by the Center for Immigration Studies. [U.S. Immigrant Population Hit Record 43.7 Million in 2016, By Steven A. Camarota and Karen Zeigler,October 16, 2017] So the 77,000 reduction in working-age immigrants from December 2016 to December 2017 is consistent with a gross inflow of about 500,000 new foreign-born workers (legal and illegal) over that period\u2014the gross inflow more than offset by the gross reduction of 600,000 due to deaths, deportations, and immigrant emigrants. This helps explain why a reduction in the immigrant workforce population reduction is compatible with reports of a recent increase in illegal immigration on the U.S. southwest border (albeit still less than at the end of the Obama Regime). The additional good news: Native-born American workers took all the jobs created this month, according to the Household Survey, which records workers\u2019 immigrant status (but not their legal status). The Household Survey reported 103,000 jobs were created last month\u2014well below the 148,000 figure found by the far more widely-cited Payroll Survey. In December 2017: Immigrant employment fell by 246,000, down by 0.93% Native-born American employment rose a whopping 349,000 \u2013 up 0.27% The immigrant employment index, set to 100.0 in January 2009, fell from 122.0 to 120.9. The native-born American employment index rose from 105.8 to 106.0.. The New VDARE American Worker Displacement Index (NVDAWDI), our term for the ratio of immigrant to native-born employment growth indexes, fell fromto(100X (120.9/106.0)) Trump may not have delivered (yet) on his promise to bring back the factory and coal jobs so many of his supporters lost during the Obama years. But by shrinking the pool of immigrants willing to do that work, he has put more money in pockets of his voters. While overall wage growth remains modest \u2013 2.5% per annum in December \u2013 Blue collar workers have beat this by a wide margin: \u201cIt is commonly said that wage stagnation contributed to an economic anxiety in middle America that carried Donald Trump into the White House\u2026Yet Mr. Trump\u2019s rise seems to have coincided with a turnaround in fortunes for the middle class. \u2026 The latest development\u2014one that will be of particular interest to Mr. Trump\u2014is that blue-collar wages have begun to rocket. \u2026In the year [2017] to the third quarter, wage and salary growth for the likes of factory workers, builders and drivers easily outstripped that for professionals and managers. In some cases, blue-collar pay growth now exceeds 4%\u2026\u201d Blue-collar wages are surging. Can it last?, The Economist, Magazine, November 14th 2017 Eleven months of Trump has not come close to undoing the damage done by eight years of Obama. Native-born American workers lost ground to their foreign-born competitors throughout the Obama years and this trend accelerated significantly in the months leading up to the election: Can't render, error Native-born American employment growth is represented by the black line, immigrant employment growth is in pink, and NVAWDI\u2014the ratio of immigrant to native-born American job growth\u2014is in blue. Another way of looking at American worker displacement: the immigrant share of total U.S. employment rose steadily, albeit erratically, throughout the Obama years. It fell sharply in the months after the 2016 election, but roared back to Obama-era levels in the spring. Immigrants held 16.99% of total jobs in December, a significant drop from November\u2019s 17.16% share. Can't render, error A detailed snapshot of American worker displacement over the past year is available in the Employment Status of the Civilian Population by Nativity table published in the monthly BLS Report. Over the last 12 months (December 2016 to December 2017): The native-born American labor force (employed plus looking for work) grew twice as fast as the immigrant labor force: 0.63% versus 0.30%.

A solar storm, which occurred Monday, is expected to strike Earth tonight. On Monday, the sun spit out a slew of charged particles in a moderate solar flare. These particles are now making their way towards Earth. The planet\u2019s magnetic field will block most of the particles, but some will make it into Earth\u2019s atmosphere. The particles collect at the north and south poles and interact with atmospheric gases to create the aurora borealis or the Northern Lights. And some say this show could be quite spectacular. Solar flares have been known to cause power grid failures, but it looks like we\u2019ll only get the light show this time. Although a grid failure is possible, it is unlikely. According to Seeker, the forecast calls for a high probability of a G-1 or \u201cminor\u201d storm, which could strengthen to a G-2 or \u201cmoderate\u201d storm depending on how the stream of particles hit the Earth. Geomagnetic storms are ranked on a scale, with G at the bottom, R in the middle, and S as the most severe. Forecasts now say the particles will give our planet a glancing blow. Although this storm has been categorized as \u201cG-1,\u201d which means it is minor, it could still cause some havoc down on Earth. Solar flares and particle ejections are associated with sunspots \u2014 dark areas on the sun\u2019s surface \u2014 that host intense magnetic activity. As the magnetic fields in a sunspot cross, NASA stated, this can cause a sudden energy explosion, also known as a solar flare. This sends radiation out into space, and that radiation can be hurled toward the Earth. G1-level storms, such as Monday\u2019s, may affect migratory animals, and can cause \u201cweak power grid fluctuations.\u201d The barrage of particles may even have a minor impact on satellites. A gird failure would almost immediately fling the United States into a state of panic, and it\u2019s always good to be prepared just in case.

The state's House of Representatives passed a bill raising the age to buy a gun from 18 to 21 and imposing a three-day waiting period on all gun sales. The bill, already passed by the Senate, now goes to the state governor. Seventeen people were killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, on 14 February. Expelled former student Nikolas Cruz, 19, has been charged in the attack. He was formally indicted by a grand jury on Wednesday on 34 counts, including 17 counts of premeditated first-degree murder and 17 counts of attempted first-degree murder. He is suspected of using a legally bought AR-15 semi-automatic rifle to carry out the 10-minute attack, gunning down teachers and students. What is in the new law? In addition to raising the age and bringing in the three-day waiting period, the legislation: Introduces a voluntary armed \"guardian programme\" for schools, named after Aaron Feis, a coach who died in the Parkland shooting. It allows school personnel to be armed, subject to school district approval and specialist training Classroom teachers are excluded from carrying arms unless they have a security forces background Bans devices, such as bump stocks, that modify a semi-automatic weapon to fully automatic Raises mental health funding and increases the power to seize or ban guns under mental health concerns The legislation does not include a ban on the sale of assault-style weapons like the AR-15, despite it being a key demand of Parkland students and their parents. Florida law already mandates a three-day waiting period for the purchase of a handgun but a person as young as 18 can buy a rifle with no waiting period. The Republican-controlled House debated the bill for about eight hours on Wednesday before voting 67-50 in favour. Has the move been welcomed? Ryan Petty, whose daughter was among those killed, hailed the House's vote in a tweet. He said: \"We know that when it comes to preventing future acts of school violence, today's vote is just the beginning of our journey.\" State Democratic Party legislators who backed the bill said it was necessary despite the \"poison pill\" of allowing more guns in schools under the guardian programme. Florida now joins at least six other states in allowing school employees to carry firearms. Following the Parkland shooting, many surviving students had lobbied politicians for greater gun control. Gun control activists will hope the Florida measures will be a turning point in their battle with the powerful National Rifle Association and others who defend firearms ownership under the Second Amendment of the US constitution. On the day the vote passed, a 17-year-old woman student was killed in a suspected accidental shooting at a high school in Alabama. What happens now? Governor Rick Scott will need to sign the bill, known as the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act, into law. It will automatically become law within 15 days unless he vetoes it. Mr Scott has not yet said he will back it, telling reporters he would \"review the bill line by line\" and consult victims' families. He has previously said he opposes US President Donald Trump's call to arm teachers. He had also previously opposed increasing the purchase age from 18 to 21.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

From the beginning of this case, it was clear that Guyger was receiving special treatment from law enforcement. One of the most glaring instances showing her privilege was the fact that the Texas Rangers said in their report that Jean refused to obey Guyger\u2019s \u201cverbal commands.\u201d Had anyone else but a cop walked into an apartment and killed an innocent man, do you believe that investigators would have said anything like this? Attorney Stephen Le Brocq, who operates a law firm in the North Texas area sums up the treatment of Guyger perfectly when he says that \u201cThe affidavit isn\u2019t written objectively, not at the slightest. As stated before, they are usually wholly against the accused. An objective view of the information related by the officer would be proper, in my opinion. This affidavit states facts based upon the word of the person it seeks to accuse of criminal wrongdoing.\u201d What\u2019s more, according to WFAA, who obtained affidavits for all of the search warrants involved in the case, none of them involved the search of Guyger\u2019s apartment. For those who don\u2019t recall, police egregiously released the search warrant findings of Jean\u2019s apartment on the day his family buried his dead body. They attempted to assassinate Jean\u2019s character by claiming they found less than a half ounce of weed in his apartment. However, they failed miserably at it. One thing in particular, however, stood out to those paying attention and that is the fact the police didn\u2019t release any information on what they found in Guyger\u2019s apartment. According to the information currently available, that\u2019s because they didn\u2019t search it. According to WFAA, there were five search warrants issued in the case\u2014none of which were for the killer\u2019s apartment. As WFAA reports: Two of the warrants allowed investigators to remove the front door of Guyger and Jean\u2019s apartment, their door locks and to download data for their door locks. An inventory return states that they removed both of their door lock and downloaded the data from the door locks. A third search warrant gave investigators the authority to enter Jean\u2019s apartment and collect additional evidence. A return shows that investigators took photographs of his apartment, made videos of his apartment, conducted \u201claser measurements of firearm trajectory,\u201d and collected \u201cgunshot residue\u201d from the door frame and kitchen wall of Jean\u2019s apartment. A return for the fourth search warrant shows investigators seized video from the surveillance camera system in the apartment management\u2019s office. A fifth search warrant gave investigators the authority to obtain all communications related to the incident in the possession of property management, as well as all surveillance video and all entry and access logs from 9 p.m. to 11 p.m. on the night of the shooting. An inventory return shows investigators seized a USB drive containing the video, an event log report for \u201clinear access doors and gates,\u201d an \u201celevator access door lock\u201d report and a \u201clock audit report for both apartments. Now, even if police would try to search the killer cop\u2019s apartment, it\u2019s too late. On Sunday, apartment staff notified residents in an email that Guyger \u201chas vacated her apartment and no longer resides at our community.\u201d A manager at the complex declined to indicate exactly when Guyger moved out and if she left the premises voluntarily, the Dallas Morning News reports. While residents can certainly sleep better knowing that they don\u2019t have to fear a killer cop walking into their apartment and murdering them, the family of Botham Jean likely sees this as one more instance of injustice. Mother of #BothamJean, Allison Jean, says the \u201csmear\u201d of her son is unacceptable. \u201cIt is time that we recognize that lives matter, my son\u2019s life matters.\u201d pic.twitter.com/UjyKRZ8XeG \u2014 Jack Highberger (@JackHighberger) September 14, 2018 Article posted with permission from The Free Thought Project\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

Prime Minister Orb\u00e1n said his government will oppose efforts by the United Nations or the European Union to \u201cincrease migration\u201d around the world. In June, LifeSiteNews reported that Orb\u00e1n had taken a strong stand and not backed down against outside globalist influences seeking to control his nation\u2019s politics. Billionaire George Soros, who famously backs many progressive initiatives around the world, locked horns with Orb\u00e1n over the Central European University (CEU) he founded in 1989, which has been criticized as a funnel for anti-nationalist views. Orb\u00e1n and Soros have a history, beginning in partnership and ending in acrimony. Orb\u00e1n started public life as a crusader against communism and attended Oxford University on a Soros scholarship. Soros, who expatriated from Hungary, also funded Orb\u00e1n\u2019s political organization, the Alliance for Young Democrats. But Orb\u00e1n\u2019s defense of conservative values has led to breaking ties with Soros, whom he now criticizes as a foreigner meddling in his country\u2019s affairs. After Prime Minister Orb\u00e1n delivered his strongly worded state of the nation speech, a UK Daily Mail report said, \u201cOrb\u00e1n has conflated the issue of immigration with the image of Soros, 87, whose name was used in a tough anti-migrant bill sent to Parliament on Wednesday.\u201d The Daily Mail report continued: Soros, for his part, compared Orb\u00e1n unfavourably to both the Nazis and the Communists, saying his rule evoked dark tones from the 1930's, when Hungary was allied with Nazi Germany. But Orb\u00e1n remains committed to his policy, claiming that Soros and supporters of migration are losing the fight. He said: \u201cSoros has antagonised not only us but also England, President Trump and Israel too. Everywhere he wants to get migration accepted. It won't work. We are not alone and we will fight together and we will succeed.\u201d In addition to inviting Soros\u2019 ire, Orb\u00e1n came under fire a couple years ago from the U.S. State Department under President Obama as well as the European Parliament for purportedly discriminating against homosexuals because of Hungary\u2019s insistence on defining marriage between a man and a woman, and that pre-born babies have rights. Last year, Orb\u00e1n also criticized liberals and encouraged citizens to give life to more children during the 11th conference of the World Congress of Families. Three thousand \u201cnatural family\u201d advocates who attended the four-day conference heard Orb\u00e1n in his opening address lambaste the European Union (EU) for its \u201crelativizing liberal ideology that\u2019s an insult to families.\u201d\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

Mueller III\u2019s Russia investigation, saying cryptically Monday the special counsel is \u201clooking for trouble.\u201d Trump alleged in a morning tweet series that the former FBI director is \u201cDisgraced and discredited,\u201d claiming his staff amounts to nothing more than a \u201cgroup of Angry Democrat Thugs.\u201d That came hours after a Sunday tweet in which he referred to the special counsel team as a \u201cgang.\u201d Both are words with loaded meanings for his conservative political base. The president\u2019s Sunday and Monday attacks on Mueller and his team came after reports that White House Counsel Donald McGahn was interviewed by Mueller and his team for more than one full day. Trump contends he signed off on the testimony; George W. Bush-era White House counsel and attorney general Alberto Gonzales, however, told CNN Monday morning that a sitting White House counsel would be required to fully cooperate with a federal investigation because he is a government lawyer, not a president\u2019s personal attorney. But Trump on Monday morning tweeted that McGahn spoke with the special counsel team for \u201cover 30 hours with the White House Councel, only with my approval, for purposes of transparency.\u201d (The tweet included a misspelling of \u201ccounsel.\u201d) The length of the Mueller-McGahn sessions led Trump to the conclusion the special counsel is \u201clooking for trouble\u201d because they \u201cthey know there is no Russian Collusion.\u201d But Mueller reportedly is keenly interested in a widely studied June 2016 Trump Tower meeting arranged by Donald Trump Jr., which included a Russian attorney who promised to hand over negative information about Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. The session also was attended by then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner; the president dictated a misleading statement about it a year later and it remains murky just when he learned about the meeting. As Roll Call has reported, Trump was in the tower at the time of the session with the Russian lawyer. The president also continued to push a line first floated by his attorney, former New York mayor and U.S. attorney Rudolph Giuliani, tweeting that campaign collusion with Russia would be a \u201cphony crime.\u201d He\u2019s right, there is no specific collusion statute. But legal experts say anyone in Trump\u2019s orbit would be charged with conspiracy, making false statements to federal investigators or obstructing justice. All are federal crimes. Trump also continued to cast himself as a victim in the matter, saying when he attempts to \u201cFIGHT BACK or say anything bad about the Rigged Witch Hunt,\u201d his critics \u201cscream Obstruction!\u201d Mueller also is looking at whether some of Trump\u2019s actions like firing then-FBI Director James B.

The unnamed worker reported, \u201csubtle and vague, but abnormal, sensations of sound and pressure.\u201d The government employee experienced the symptoms from late 2017 until April of 2018, according to the U.S. State Department. \u201cThe employee was sent to the United States for further evaluation. On May 18, 2018, the Embassy learned that the clinical findings of this evaluation matched mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI),\u201d Jinnie Lee, U.S. Embassy spokesperson in Beijing, told Gizmodo by email. \u201cThe Chinese government has assured us they are also investigating and taking appropriate measures,\u201d Lee continued. But this isn\u2019t the first time a sound weapon has been used on American diplomats. Cuba has been accused of using a similar device to cause brain trauma in Americans at the embassy in Havana. It all started in the fall of 2016. Several of the affected diplomats were recent arrivals at the embassy, which reopened in 2015 as part of Barack Obama\u2019s reestablishment of diplomatic relations with Cuba. The Daily Mail reported that one diplomat described being jolted awake in a Havana hotel room by a grinding, blaring cacophony. When he moved a few feet across the room, the noise stopped. When he got back into bed, the agonizing sound hit him again; as if, he told doctors, he had walked through some invisible wall cutting straight down the middle of his room. Whether they heard anything or not, the consequences have been unmistakable \u2014 symptoms ranging from nosebleeds, nausea, dizziness and severe headaches to mild brain damage and permanent hearing or memory loss. Oddly, as soon as some of the victims left Cuba, they stopped hearing noises. \u2013SHTFPlan The mysterious illnesses reported by U.S. government employees in Cuba are allegedly thought to be either a \u201csonic attack\u201d or perhaps malfunctioning surveillance gear. It\u2019s not known yet whether the injured government worker in China was targeted with any such device, despite reporting similar symptoms as the diplomats in Cuba. The U.S. Consulate in Guangzhou says that it hasn\u2019t had any other reported cases of strange sounds being heard by American officials, but is taking the issue seriously. \u201cIf you have concerns about any symptoms or medical problems that developed during or after a stay in China, consult a medical professional,\u201d the State Department said in a public release. \u201cWhile in China, if you experience any unusual acute auditory or sensory phenomena accompanied by unusual sounds or piercing noises, do not attempt to locate their source. Instead, move to a location where the sounds are not present,\u201d the release said. The Cuban government continues to deny they attacked U.S. diplomats with a sonic weapon, and very little additional information is known about those who suffered through the strange ordeal. After months of investigations, U.S. officials concluded that the diplomats had been exposed to an advanced device that operated outside the range of audible sound and had been deployed either inside or outside their residences. It was not immediately clear if the device was a weapon used in a deliberate attack, or had some other purpose.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

And Google likely violated federal election laws \u2014 not to mention the privacy of its users \u2014 in the services it provided the Clinton campaign. Fox News\u2019 Tucker Carlson read an internal email on Monday night\u2019s show that outlined in a Google\u2019 executive\u2019s own words how the company was providing a \u201csilent donation\u201d to a group that was creating ads and donating funds to bus Latinos to voting stations in key swing states. The email was sent by Eliana Murillo, the former head of Google\u2019s multicultural marketing department. The email was forwarded to Google vice presidents and other staff members throughout the company, Carlson said. According to Carlson: In her email, Mario touts Google\u2019s multi-faceted efforts to boost Hispanic turnout in the election. She noticed that Latino voters did record-breaking numbers, especially in states like Florida, Nevada and Arizona \u2014 the last of which she describes as \u201ca key state for us.\u201d She brags that the company used its power to ensure that millions of people saw certain hashtags and social media impressions, with the goal of influencing their behavior during the election.\u201d Murillo also brags that Google, \u201cused its power to ensure that millions of people saw certain hashtags and social media impressions, with the goal of influencing their behavior during the election.\u201d Unfortunately for Clinton and Google, as Murillo lamented, \u201c\u2026ultimately after all was said and done, the Latino community did come out to vote, and completely surprised us. We never anticipated that 29% of Latinos would vote for Trump. No one did.\u201d The assistance Google provided to the Clinton campaign likely violated election laws and served as an unreported in-kind contribution. Of course, anyone who paid attention was aware of Google\u2019s attempts to interfere on Clinton\u2019s behalf. WikiLeaks\u2019 Julian Assange revealed two years ago that Google CEO Eric Schmidt and a number of Google employees created a company in 2015 specifically to place Clinton the White House. Emails obtained by WikiLeaks showed correspondence between Schmidt and Clinton, along with a number of Clinton operatives discussing strategy meetings and campaign ideas. Among the strategies was the creation of a voter tracking database using smart phones. A report by a research team earlier this year found that Google can manipulate opinions of undecided voters by inserting negative search suggestions under the name of a candidate. Meanwhile, Trump took to Twitter early Tuesday morning to note the Department of Justice\u2019s inaction over the fact that disgraced anti-Trump FBI agent Peter Strzok and his mistress were engaged in a \u201cmedia leak strategy\u201d to plant negative stories which were then used to secure FISA warrants to spy on the Trump campaign.

In this article, the author was calling out a Christian for protesting a corrupt representative in government, even going so far as to suggest this protestant ought to have stayed home to read their Bible rather than to protest corruption in government.

Maybe he should have taken the time to look to the founding forefathers and that document which they drew up called \u201cThe Declaration of Independence.\u201d That document alone is 75% of the usurpations that the Tyrant King George committed against our forefathers and what it is that our forefathers would not put up with. Our American history found in that document teaches that our forefathers threw off the tyrant that would not be ruled by God and declared \u201cResistance to tyrants is obedience to God!\" Furthermore, the motto of the American Revolution was \u201cNo King but King Jesus.\u201d America\u2019s original national seal was \u201cREBELLION TO TYRANTS IS OBEDIENCE TO GOD\u201d with a picture on the inside of the seal showing the Pharaoh being overthrown by the sea with Moses and the children of Israel safe on the shore. John Hancock, the first signer of the Declaration of Independence, said, \u201cResistance to tyranny becomes the Christian duty of each individual\u2026 Continue steadfast and, with a proper sense of your dependence on God, nobly defend those rights which Heaven gave, and no man ought to take from us.\u201d (History of the United States of America, Volume. 2 p. 229) Apparently, this individual who wrote the article knows nothing of the Black Robed Regiment that the tyrant King George feared the most. The Black Robed regiment, were in fact, the preachers that went before the Forefathers in educating the colonies to resistance when it came to the corrupt King on the other side of the pond. They sacrificed themselves to establish the freedoms in which he enjoys today. The author went on to write that this protestant should know what the Bible says about those in authority. First of all, the authority given to our representative government is derived from \u201cWe the People.\u201d We receive our rights from God, and in turn, delegate power to those who serve \u201cWe the People.\u201d Representatives work for us, we do not work for them. \u201cThey are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights\u2026 Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their powers from the consent of the governed.\u201d -The Declaration of Independence He then quotes Romans 13: 1-7 Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God. Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation. For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same: For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil. Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake. For for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God's ministers, attending continually upon this very thing. Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour. The first Scripture says: Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God. God ordained the power, and that \u201crulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil.\" Did God tell His Church to submit to that which He condemns? (Deuteronomy 25:1; Proverbs 17:15) Absolutely not! Is the Church to transgress His Laws, or to magnify and enforce His Laws unto judgment? (Psalm 40:8; Romans 3:31) Of course not! If He did, that would make God unjust. Jesus said, \"Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil\u201d (Matthew 5:17). The Lord has, in fact, commanded nowhere in Scripture for the Church to submit to the wicked. The Bible teaches just the exact opposite.

But if we don\u2019t speak about such facts, how will we ever convince Muslims not to follow \u201chardline interpretations of the Qur\u2019an\u201d? Another problem with Farage\u2019s statement is that it manifests a remarkable ignorance of history. While he is deeply concerned that British people not begin to think that resisting jihad terror means that they are in a \u201cbattle\u201d with the \u201centire religion\u201d of Islam, he appears unaware of the fact that many Muslims throughout history have considered their entire religion to be at war with the entire non-Muslim world. I document this abundantly in my new book The History of Jihad From Muhammad to ISIS . To take one of innumerable examples, Sharaf ad-Din Ali Yazdi, a fifteenth-century Persian who wrote a biography of the Mongol Muslim warrior Tamerlane, observed that \u201cthe Qur\u2019an says the highest dignity man can attain is that of making war in person against the enemies of his religion. Muhammad advises the same thing, according to the tradition of the Muslim doctors: wherefore the great Temur always strove to exterminate the infidels, as much to acquire that glory, as to signalise himself by the greatness of his conquests.\u201d After conquest came dhimmitude, the subjugated status that the Qur\u2019an mandates for \u201cthe People of the Book\u201d (primarily Jews and Christians). In the early twelfth century, the Fatimid caliph Al-Amir bi-Ahkamillah issued this edict: Now, the prior degradation of the infidels in this world before the life to come\u2014where it is their lot\u2014is considered an act of piety; and the imposition of their poll tax [jizya], \u201cuntil they pay the tribute out of hand and have been humbled\u201d (Koran 9:29) is a divinely ordained obligation\u2026.The dhimmi\u2019s payment of his dues by a bill drawn on a Muslim, or by delegating a real believer to pay it in his name will not be tolerated. It must be exacted from him directly in order to vilify and humiliate him, so that Islam and its people may be exalted and the race of infidels brought low. The jizya is to be imposed on all of them in full, without exception. Underlying this subjugation is a deep contempt for non-Muslims. In the year 718, the Umayyad caliph Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz sent out a message to the governors of the various Islamic provinces: O you who believe! The non-Muslims are nothing but dirt. Allah has created them to be partisans of Satan; most treacherous in regard to all they do; whose whole endeavor in this nether life is useless, though they themselves imagine that they are doing fine work. Upon them rests the curse of Allah, of the Angels and of man collectively We must not think that we are at war with the entire religion. But what, Mr. Farage, are we to think about the Muslims who consider themselves and their religion to be at war with us? Nigel Farage has become just another mainstream hack politician.

But health officials are now warning the deadly bacteria could mutate and become untreatable as it spreads across the globe. Coupled with the high likelihood that this disease could spread globally by an infected traveler getting on a plane to Europe or America, health officials are now warning that the strain of plague which has already killed more than 140 Madagascar could mutate and become untreatable. Professor Paul Hunter has warned that, while it would be rather easy for an advanced country to contain the disease in its current form, he fears that it could evolve into something far more dangerous. Hunter, who is a disease expert at the University of East Anglia, told the Daily Star: \u201cIf it reaches the UK, Europe or the US it would be similar to the Ebola outbreak. We would have a few isolated cases but it shouldn\u2019t spread like it has in Madagascar.\u201d But he had more to add. \u201cAs with any disease, it\u2019s a real worry that it mutates and become untreatable,\u201d Hunter said. So far, the majority of the recent cases of the black death have the been pneumonic plague, a more deadly form of the bubonic plague which devastated Europe\u2019s population in the 1300s. While the bubonic plague is spread through the bites of infected fleas, pneumonic plague is spread through the air, usually by coughing. Airborne infections are difficult at best to control. Symptoms of the plague include a very high fever, coughing (potentially coughing up blood), and headaches. Ten African nations have already been put on alert that the plague could easily spread to their region of the globe. The plague can be fatal 24-48 hours after infection, but antibiotics will take care of the infection. Schools and universities have been closed with a ban issued on public gatherings, such as the tradition of \u201cdancing with the dead\u201d which has been partially blamed for the disease\u2019s spread. The current outbreak is also highly unusual as it has affected urban areas increasing the risk of transmission, according to the World Health Organization. WHO has delivered 1.2 million doses of antibiotics to fight the disease while the Red Cross has been training hundreds of volunteers on the island to publicize preventative measures.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

Westerville police late Saturday confirmed that the suspect is Quentin Lamar Smith. Authorities released incident reports showing police had been to his home or had dealings with him several times since 2017. In a Nov. 29 incident, police say his wife, 33-year-old Candace Smith, asked about protection orders because she and Quentin Smith weren't getting along. She accused her husband of threatening to kill her, their daughter and himself. She told police he had a gun.

World Health Chief: Global Pandemic Imminent According to a World Health Organization doctor, a global pandemic is imminent, and no one will be prepared for it when it hits. Dr. Tedros Adhanom, director-general for WHO, has said that the next outbreak that will hit us will be a \u201cterrible\u201d one, causing a large death all over the world. \u201cHumanity is more vulnerable in the face of epidemics because we are much more connected and we travel around much more quickly than before,\u201d said WHO specialist in infectious diseases Dr. Sylvie Brand. \u201cWe know that it is coming, but we have no way of stopping it,\u201d said Brand. According to Dr. Tedros, the flu is extremely dangerous to everyone living on the planet. This fear was also promoted by experts at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland last month. The claims came exactly 100 years after the 1918 Spanish flu that claimed 50 million lives and killed three times as many people as World War I. A mutated strain is the most likely contender to wipe out millions because it can join together with other strains to become deadlier. \u201cThis is not some future nightmare scenario. A devastating epidemic could start in any country at any time and kill millions of people because we are still not prepared. The world remains vulnerable. We do not know where and when the next global pandemic will occur, but we know it will take a terrible toll both on human life and on the economy,\u201d said Dr. Tedros. \u201cHidden underneath this fear-mongering message of a global pandemic is a far more sinister W.H.O. agenda,\u201d warns Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, publisher of Medicine.news. \u201cThe real agenda is a global push for blind, fear-based acceptance of unsafe, unproven vaccines that will be rolled out alongside the next global pandemic,\u201d Adams warns. \u201cFear circumvents rational thinking, which is why the vaccine-pharma cartels routinely turn to irrational fear propaganda to demand absolute and unquestioning acceptance of risky medical interventions that should always be scrutinized for safety and efficacy.\u201d \u2013Natural News Dr. Tedros\u2019 comments come on the heels of the plague outbreak in Madagascar, which was the most recent epidemic to receive international aid attention amid fears it would spread. More than 200 people were killed during the outbreak that ravaged the island over the winter, which prompted 10 nearby African countries to be placed on high alert.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

It is the DRC's ninth known outbreak of Ebola since 1976, when the deady viral disease was first identified in then-Zaire by a Belgian-led team. In Geneva, the World Health Organization (WHO) said lab tests in the DRC confirmed the presence of Ebola virus in two out of five samples collected from patients. \"WHO is working closely with the government of the DRC to rapidly scale up its operations and mobilize health partners, using the model of a successful response to a similar... outbreak in 2017,\" it said in a statement. It said it had released $1 million (840,000 euros) from an emergency contingency fund, set up a coordination group and deployed more than 50 experts to work with the DRC government and health agencies. \"The action plan prepared by the health ministry has been approved,\" an official statement released after a cabinet meeting said. - No new deaths - \"Since the notification of the cases on May 3, no deaths have been reported,\" it said, without specifying when the first case came to light. The outbreak occurred in Bikoro, on the shores of Lake Tumba. All the cases were reported from a clinic at Ilkoko Iponge, located about 30 kilometres (20 miles) from Bikoro, where treatment capacities are limited, the WHO said. A team of experts from the WHO, Doctors without Borders (DRC) and Equateur province travelled to Bikoro on Tuesday to beef up coordination and carry out investigations, it said. Ebola is one of the world's most notorious diseases, being both highly infectious and extremely lethal. It is caused by a virus that has a natural reservoir in the bat, which does not itself fall ill, but can pass the microbe on to humans who hunt it for \"bushmeat\". The virus is handed on by contact with bodily fluids -- touching a sick or dead person is a well-known source of infection. Following an incubation period of between two and 21 days, Ebola develops into a high fever, weakness, intense muscle and joint pain, headaches and a sore throat. That is often followed by vomiting and diarrhoea, skin eruptions, kidney and liver failure, and internal and external bleeding. The worst-ever Ebola outbreak started in December 2013 in southern Guinea before spreading to two neighbouring west African countries, Liberia and Sierra Leone. That outbreak killed more than 11,300 people out of nearly 29,000 registered cases, according to WHO estimates, although the real figure is thought to be significantly higher. More than 99 percent of victims were in the three West African countries, although cases occurred in other parts of the world, often stirring panic. There is no current vaccine to prevent Ebola or licensed treatment for it, although a range of experimental drugs are in development. Early care with rehydration may boost the chance of survival. Given the lack of a pharmaceutical weapon against Ebola, health experts have responded with time-honoured measures of control, prevention and containment. They use rigorous protocols to protect medical personnel with disposable full-body suits, masks, goggles and gloves and disinfecting sprays.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

At the Hammonds\u2019 original sentencing, the judge noted that they are respected in the community and that imposing the mandatory minimum, 5-year prison sentence would \u201cshock the conscience\u201d and be \u201cgrossly disproportionate to the severity\u201d of their conduct. As a result, the judge imposed significantly lesser sentences. The previous administration, however, filed an overzealous appeal that resulted in the Hammonds being sentenced to five years in prison. This was unjust. Dwight Hammond is now 76 years old and has served approximately three years in prison. Steven Hammond is 49 and has served approximately four years in prison. They have also paid $400,000 to the United States to settle a related civil suit. The Hammonds are devoted family men, respected contributors to their local community, and have widespread support from their neighbors, local law enforcement, and farmers and ranchers across the West. Justice is overdue for Dwight and Steven Hammond, both of whom are entirely deserving of these Grants of Executive Clemency. Well, it took long enough, but thank you President Trump. You did the right thing in this matter. And for all those who took the time to keep this story alive and urge people to petition the White House on behalf of the Hammonds, thank you! It should be noted that the protests that took place in Oregon a couple of years ago were a response to the injustice the Hammonds faced.

Westerville Police Chief Joe Morbitzer said officer Eric Joering, 39, died at the scene and his colleague, Anthony Morelli, 54, died at a local hospital. Smith was charged with two counts of aggravated murder on Sunday. Morbitzer said the officers were responding to a \u201cpotential domestic situation.\u201d A neighbor who heard the gunfire said it happened at a home where the occupants were \u201calways arguing and fighting.\u201d \u201cThe officers gave their lives in defense of others,\u201d Morbitzer said during a news conference, struggling to keep his emotions in check. He called them \u201ctrue American heroes.\u201d The Columbus Police Department is investigating the shootings. Police released incident reports showing officers had been to Smith\u2019s home or had dealings with him several times since 2017, some for alleged domestic violence involving a woman identified in the reports as his wife, Candace Smith. Authorities said he was wounded and was treated at a hospital. In a Nov. 29 incident, Candace Smith, 33, went to a police station and asked about protection orders because she said she and her husband weren\u2019t getting along and she discovered she had a sexually transmitted disease. She also told police that when she \u201cthreatens to leave Quentin, he tells her that he would kill her, their daughter, and himself,\u201d the report said. Candace Smith told police her husband \u201chas a gun that he carries all of the time, and if it isn\u2019t on him, it is close by.\u201d Police were called to the home later that night to investigate a report of domestic violence.[More] Anyhow, they have now released a different photo (above)and it is the same guy, and he is black.

The Keynote Speaker at the event was Governor of Virginia Terry McAuliffe. Other speakers included: United States Representative Alcee Hastings; then-Florida Democratic Party Chairman Stephen Bittel, who resigned in November over allegations of sexually inappropriate behavior; and then-Palm Beach County Party Chairwoman Terrie Rizzo, who was elected in December to take over for Bittel as Chair of the Florida Democratic Party. Prior to the speakers, there was a joint invocation performed by a rabbi, two pastors and an imam. The imam, Maulana Shafayat Mohamed, is notorious for his unapologetic vilification of homosexuals. Shafayat Mohamed is the imam of the Darul Uloom Institute, located in Pembroke Pines, Florida. The mosque has been a haven for terror-related individuals and activity. \u201cDirty Bomber\u201d Jose Padilla was a student of Shafayat Mohamed\u2019s at Darul Uloom. Now-deceased al-Qaeda Global Operations Chief, Adnan el-Shukrijumah, was a prayer leader at Darul Uloom. And Darul Uloom Arabic teacher Imran Mandhai, along with mosque goers Hakki Aksoy and Shueyb Mossa Jokhan, hatched a plot at the mosque to blow up different South Florida structures, including area power stations, Jewish businesses, and a National Guard armory. While terrorism plays a huge role in his mosque\u2019s history \u2013 and he has been around for all of it \u2013 Shafayat Mohamed\u2019s personal history deals much more in bigotry than terror. One stop on Shafayat Mohamed\u2019s Facebook page and one can view his profile photo of him holding a dark green book with gold border and letters on the cover. The book is \u201cThe Meaning of THE HOLY QUR\u2019AN,\u201d a version of the Quran that was banned by the Los Angeles public school system, in February 2002, for containing numerous anti-Semitic commentaries. In it, Jews are described as: \u201carrogant,\u201d \u201cjealous,\u201d \u201cselfish,\u201d \u201cspiteful,\u201d \u201cgreedy,\u201d \u201ccursed,\u201d \u201capes and swine,\u201d and \u201cunder divine displeasure.\u201d This may seem an innocent mistake on the imam\u2019s part, but his actions against the gay community and sinister views are anything but. In February 2005, an article written by Shafayat Mohamed was published on the Darul Uloom website, entitled \u2018Tsunami: Wrath of God.\u2019 In it, he claims that gay sex caused the 2004 Indonesian tsunami and that most Jews and Christians, whom he refers to as \u201cPeople of the Book,\u201d are \u201cperverted transgressors.\u201d It is writings such as these that have gotten Shafayat Mohamed thrown off a number of Broward County boards. Even so, the imam has been unrepentant. In a speech he gave at Darul Uloom, in August 2015, titled \u2018Quraan Torah Bible Forbid Man Marrying Man,\u2019 he admitted that he \u201cgot sacked from many [county] boards, because there were a lot of gay people who said, \u2018We don\u2019t want him on that board.\u2019\u201d He said he had a choice, to \u201csit in Paradise or\u2026 sit on the board and go to Hell.\u201d He began his speech by attacking President Barack Obama for supporting same-sex marriage. He asked the following, \u201cDid you hear what President Obama said?\u2026 Do you know what a sad situation we are in this country?... Here you have the President of the United States of America saying that a man could marry a man?\u2026 Are we sleeping? Do you believe in the Quran? Are we gonna sit and have the Quran be ridiculed?\u201d He then cited the Christian and Jewish Bible, barking loudly, \u201cThe Bible says that if a man sleeps with a man, he should be killed!\u201d Shafayat Mohamed later lamented the existence of Muslim homosexuals. He decried, \u201cListen. Don\u2019t deny it. They already got Muslim gay communities.\u201d He as well spoke of his support for polygamy, an act that is illegal in the United States. He exclaimed, \u201cHere the President says a man can marry a man, but you can\u2019t say a man can have four wives\u2026!\u201d The October TKJ Dinner was not the first Democrat event Shafayat Mohamed has participated in. In fact, he has been involved in many, including giving the invocations at the Florida Democratic Party\u2019s annual Leadership Blue Gala in 2014 (featuring Bill Clinton), 2015 and 2016. And given that this author has written about this before, the October event will probably not be the last occasion that he is embraced by the Democratic Party. Shafayat Mohamed is not the only Muslim extremist that has participated in the Democratic Party\u2019s TKJ Dinner. In October 2015, the dinner invocation was performed by Wilfredo Amr Ruiz, the legal adviser of the American Muslim Association of North America (AMANA), a group that actively promotes former KKK leader and white supremacist David Duke. Ruiz, as well, founded AMANA\u2019s Connecticut and Puerto Rico chapters. In July 2010, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) condemned Ruiz\u2019s AMANA for posting what the ADL called a \u201cvenomous\u201d anti-Semitic Duke video onto the group\u2019s official website. AMANA is currently promoting another anti-Semitic Duke-produced video, on the AMANA site. The President of AMANA, Sofian Zakkout, has referred to Duke as \u201cDavid Duke, a man to believe in!\u201d By inviting people like Shafayat Mohamed, an avowed enemy of the gay community, and Wilfredo Ruiz, whose group promotes white supremacists, to participate in its functions, the Democratic Party has effectively revealed its disregard for the concerns of those it disingenuously claims to advocate\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

Having been raised in Remi de Roo\u2019s Victoria in the 1970s, I had naturally never heard anything at all about the Eucharist. The understanding that Catholics believed what they believe about it came as a bit of a shock. (Read the full document here. ) With the hindsight of 52 years and a great deal of very dirty and unappealing water under the Catholic bridge, we can see it as a kind of warning prophecy. Published just three months before the close of Vatican II and just as Annibale Bugnini was cranking open the floodgates of his never-ending stream of liturgical alterations, Mysterium Fidei is now an important marker of a critical turning point in Catholic history, perhaps the most important of modern times. Who can read this without cringing at what we now know was about to happen: Therefore, we earnestly hope that the restored sacred liturgy will bring forth abundant fruits of eucharistic devotion, so that the Holy Church, under this saving sign of piety, may make daily progress toward perfect unity and may invite all Christians to a unity of faith and of love, drawing them gently, thanks to the action of divine grace. But in 1983 at the start of my personal investigations into the Catholic religion, I knew nothing of any of that. The encyclical, the very first I ever read, was also a marker for me of a personal turning point. It was the first time I had ever seen Catholic eucharistic doctrine clearly and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 unapologetically stated. It came right out and said something so astounding, something so completely unlikely, that I had to admit that it left very few logical possibilities. Like C.S. Lewis\u2019s assessment of the claims by Christ of His own divinity, this pope was either mad, bad or telling the plain truth. Something that may be much more noteworthy now in our current circumstances than it was the year I read it, is that the pope\u2019s very first quote was not of scripture, but the Council of Trent: \u201cAt the Last Supper, on the night He was handed over, Our Lord instituted the Eucharistic Sacrifice of His Body and Blood, to perpetuate the sacrifice of the cross throughout the ages until He should come, and thus entrust to the Church, His beloved spouse, the memorial of His death and resurrection: a sacrament of devotion, a sign of unity, a bond of charity, a paschal banquet in which Christ is received, the soul is filled with grace and there is given to us the pledge of future glory.\u201d In these words are highlighted both the sacrifice, which pertains to the essence of the Mass which is celebrated daily, and the sacrament in which the faithful participate in Holy Communion by eating the Flesh of Christ and drinking His Blood, receiving both grace, the beginning of eternal life, and the medicine of immortality. I remember my thoughts upon reading this shocking statement\u2026 \u201cBy doing what?!\u201d My acceptance from the reading of this document of the Church\u2019s orthodox eucharistic doctrine was based in part on Pope Paul\u2019s gracious and beautiful exposition, and in part on the sheer radical, mad unlikeliness of it. What could conceivably be the reason to say anything as wild as this if it weren\u2019t true? The idea of transubstantiation struck me as I read that document as possibly the strangest and most earth shattering thing I\u2019d ever heard. It shocked me out of a kind of swamp of intellectual worldliness; presenting the idea to my thirsty mind that there could indeed be fantastic realities far more wonderful than the banal and painfully uninteresting secularist worldview I had been taught to accept. It was as though someone had plausibly told me that, yes, there were fairies and magical kingdoms in real life, \u201cjust around the corner\u201d. By the time I read it, I had been through a long, slow transition from a childhood devoted to Our Lady and confirmed in my belief in wonders, to a kind of disappointed practical atheism after three years in a diocesan Catholic parochial school. I had been taught, by both word and implication, that everything the Catholic Church had taught before Vatican II was pernicious nonsense. Where it was simply wrong it was ridiculous and where it was wrong and political it was outright wicked. What led me to read that particular encyclical is the most clearly identifiable moment of actual grace in my young life to that point. It was the first time it occurred to me to investigate, like an anthropologist, what the Church herself said about her teachings. While mulling grimly one day over all the wickedness of the Catholic Church, I was pulled up short by a single thought: \u201cI could be wrong.\u201d At 17 it seemed such an unlikely thing to think I was rather shocked. But stopping a moment to consider, I realised that I had only ever heard about Catholic things from people who clearly hated the Church; her enemies, in short. It hardly seemed just to convict on the testimony of these obviously biased witnesses. In order to properly and thoroughly condemn the Church, with convincing due diligence, I had to read something about it that didn\u2019t come from her enemies. The same day, I presented myself at the reference desk of the public library and asked, \u201cDo you have any books about Catholicism? Something official?\u201d The librarian took me to the reference section and showed me the shelves of encyclicals, documents and histories. Saints and popes from one end of the stacks to the other.

However, one individual who represents the Muslim community of South Florida, Sofian Zakkout, is enamored with Duke and has been promoting Duke\u2019s bigoted work for many years. Last month, once again, Zakkout chose to showcase this work by posting four consecutive Duke videos on his (Zakkout\u2019s) personal Facebook page. The postings can be rivaled only by Zakkout\u2019s own documented bigotry. Sofian Abdelaziz Zakkout is the President of the American Muslim Association of North America (AMANA). He has ties to two dozen mosques stretching from Palm Beach County down to Miami-Dade. On September 21, 2017, Zakkout took to Facebook and posted four David Duke videos. Three of the videos were put out by Duke\u2019s official website, DavidDuke.com, one referring to CNN news anchor Wolf Blitzer as a \u201cJewish Zionist Agent.\u201d The fourth video was a news report featuring a clip of Duke being interviewed at a white nationalist rally held in Charlottesville, Virginia this past August. At this same rally, a white nationalist plowed his car into a group of people who were protesting the rally, killing one. This was not the first time Zakkout has promoted David Duke. Indeed, he has done so for years. In February 2016, Zakkout publicized on his Facebook page a bizarre Duke report, titled in part \u2018Dr. David Duke Exposes the Real Racist Jewish Supremacists Who Orchestrate the Destruction of European Mankind\u2026\u2019 Above the posting, Zakkout wrote of Duke, \u201cI respect him for his honesty!\u201d In October 2015, Zakkout posted to Facebook a Duke video, within which Duke makes the wild claim that there has been a \u201ccomplete takeover of American foreign policy and\u2026 American politics by Jewish extremists.\u201d Above the video on Facebook, Zakkout praised Duke, exclaiming \u201cDavid Duke, a man to believe in!\u201d In July 2010, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) condemned Zakkout and his group AMANA for featuring another anti-Semitic Duke video on the AMANA website. The ADL described the video as \u201cvenomous.\u201d Currently, AMANA\u2019s official website contains one more Duke video. David Duke\u2019s bigoted and inciting material is not the only hate Zakkout promotes. He also pedals much bigotry coming from others, including himself. In July 2017, Zakkout posted on his Facebook page a four-minute portion of a speech given by Louis Farrakhan at the Nation of Islam\u2019s February 2017 Saviors\u2019 Day. On the video, Farrakhan repeatedly refers to Jews as \u201cSatan.\u201d He states to his audience: \u201cReally, they\u2019re not Jews. No, that\u2019s Satan. You should learn to call them by their real name, \u2018Satan.\u2019 You\u2019re coming face to face with Satan, the Arch Deceiver, the enemy of God, and the enemy of the righteous.\u201d In June 2016, Zakkout clicked \u2018like\u2019 under someone else\u2019s Facebook posting (on Zakkout\u2019s personal Facebook page) of a grotesque cartoon containing a worried-looking religious Jew hiding behind an animated tree with a bearded man brandishing a rifle coming towards them. The tree is speaking to the man in Arabic, saying \u201cOh Muslim! Oh Muslim! There is a Jew behind me. Come and kill him.\u201d In April 2016, Zakkout promoted a report discussing the absurd notion of Jewish involvement in the September 11th attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. A photo from the report shows the burning towers with a Jewish Star affixed to one. The report begins, \u201cIt ain\u2019t debatable! Soup to nuts, top to bottom, the 9/11/01 terrorist attacks on New York City and Washington D.C. were an \u2018Israeli\u2019-Jewish job.\u201d The website which published the report and which Zakkout linked to is Mouqawamah Music, a site that openly calls for \u201cDeath to Israel\u201d and labels the Jewish religion \u201cwicked and filth-ridden.\u201d In February 2016, Zakkout circulated on social media a report claiming that \u201cthe Holocaust was faked.\u201d It begins: \u201cThe alleged \u2018Holocaust\u2019 of \u20186 million Jews\u2019 at the hands of Adolf Hitler and National Socialist Germany during WWII is the biggest lie ever foisted upon humanity.\u201d It was produced by The Realist Report, an anti-Jew, anti-black, anti-gay independent media outlet, which describes Hitler as \u201cthe greatest leader in modern Western history.\u201d In December 2015, Zakkout posted a photo of Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Chief of Staff Gadi Eizenkot, who is a decorated veteran of many different wars and battles fought by Israel over the last three-plus decades. Above the picture of Eizenkot, Zakkout wrote in Arabic, \u201cYou\u2019re a Jew, the grandson of a monkey and a pig.\u201d He signed it \u201cSofian.\u201d This is one of many times Zakkout has referred to Jews as \u201cmonkeys and pigs.\u201d In July 2014, Zakkout organized a pro-Hamas rally held outside the Israeli Consulate in downtown Miami. On video, Zakkout is shown smiling, as event goers repeatedly shout, \u201cWe are Hamas.\u201d After the rally, Zakkout wrote the following in Arabic, above photos from the event: \u201cThank God, every day we conquer the American Jews like our conquests over the Jews of Israel!\u201d He signed it \u201cBr. Sofian Zakkout.\u201d South Florida Muslim leader Sofian Zakkout\u2019s promotion of bigotry, whether borrowed from others or his own, has been evident for years. Yet, there is no outcry from the community, not from Muslims, not from non-Muslims. It has been virtually ignored by everyone, save this author and his colleague, Director of Militant Islam Monitor Beila Rabinowitz. Despite their having been notified by this author about Zakkout\u2019s perfidious activities, Zakkout remains an active member of the boards of Citizens\u2019 Crime Watch of Miami-Dade County and Crime Stoppers of Miami-Dade County. These organizations have provided and continue to provide Zakkout with a facade of respectability. In reality, he has done nothing to serve the community and only attempts to divide it with his hatemongering. It is time for Zakkout to be exposed and stripped of his public functions.

Fox News reports: A spokesperson for Feinstein declined Fox News\u2019 request to elaborate on the lawmaker\u2019s statement, but there has been much speculation that she is referring to a secret letter that has been the subject of intrigue on Capitol Hill over the last few days. A source familiar with the confirmation proceedings told Fox News that Feinstein received the letter back in July, but did not make its existence known publicly until Thursday. According to a report by The Intercept, the letter was relayed to lawmakers by an individual affiliated with Stanford University and concerns an incident involving the 53-year-old Kavanaugh and a woman while they were in high school. According to two officials who spoke anonymously with the New York Times, the incident involved possible sexual misconduct between Kavanaugh and the woman. The letter reportedly was given to Feinstein by Rep. Anna Eshoo, D-Calif., but has not been publicly disclosed by senators who have seen the document. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said that the letter in question has been referred to the FBI for investigation. The FBI conducts background checks on all major government appointees, including Supreme Court nominees. \u201cUpon receipt of the information on the night of September 12, we included it as part of Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s background file, as per the standard process,\u201d the FBI said in a statement. The White House has called this nothing more than a last minute gambit, and that would be correct. In fact, the FBI has no plans to pursue any investigation regarding the allegation. According to The Washington Post: According to a person familiar with the matter, the FBI does not now plan to launch a criminal investigation of the matter, which would normally be handled by local authorities, if it was within the statute of limitations. The FBI instead passed the material to the White House, as an update to Kavanaugh's background check, which already had been completed, the person said. The move is similar to what the bureau did when allegations were leveled against former White House aide Rob Porter. ... Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) dismissed the controversy on Twitter. \u201cLet me get this straight: this is [a] statement about [a] secret letter regarding a secret matter and an unidentified person.

If they wanted something on the guy, why don't they bring up his involvement in the Vince Foster cover-up? Now, that would be something to really look into, but not with the corrupt DOJ and FBI we currently have.

Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum and others are expressing outrage at the special provision made for these voters. The Miami Herald reported that Bay County Supervisor of Elections Mark Andersen said on Monday that 11 ballots were accepted by email and 147 were faxed in, though Florida law only permits those serving in the military overseas to use these methods\u2026. According to the Herald, Gov. Rick Scott issued an executive order on Oct. 18 allowing election supervisors in Bay County and other counties impacted by the storm to extend early voting days and designate more early voting locations, but did not make provision for voting by fax or email.

            "question": "Which of the following tactics is used in the following text?\n\nArticle: \ufeffCommunion to Adulterers Promulgated as \"Authentic Magisterium\" Last week, Acta Apostolicae Sedis (AAS)\u2014the Vatican's organ for promulgating the Official Acts of the Apostolic See\u2014published Pope Francis' October 2016 letter to the bishops of Buenos Aires in which he praised their episcopal guidelines allowing divorced and civilly remarried Catholics to receive Holy Communion in some cases while living in a state of objective mortal sin. If papal clarification was ever needed on the long-debated issue of the intended meaning of Amoris Laetitia chapter VIII, such clarification has now been provided for the Church at large. Concerning these guidelines that allow \"the possibility of access to the sacraments of Reconciliation and the Eucharist\" in \"complex circumstances\" where \"limitations that lessen the responsibility and guilt\" permit adulterous couples to continue in adultery, the pope said in his letter: \"The document is very good and completely explains the meaning of chapter VIII of Amoris Laetitia. There are no other interpretations.\" Until now, the pope's letter to the Argentinian bishops had been considered a private letter with no binding force, whereas AAS has now elevated Pope Francis' letter to the official magisterial status of an \"Apostolic Letter,\" while including a special rescript as an addendum by Cardinal Pietro Parolin, Secretary of State. The rescript declares that Pope Francis expressly intends both documents\u2014the papal letter and the episcopal guidelines\u2014to bear the character of his \"authentic Magisterium,\" and that the pope has personally ordered their publication in AAS and on the Vatican website. Hence Amoris Laetitia VIII, which proposes that people living in adultery can be guiltless and thus be admitted to the sacraments of Confession and Communion when \"concrete circumstances\" make it difficult to renounce their adulterous state, is now declared \"magisterial\" by the Holy See. The problem with this is that heresy or sacrilege can never be declared magisterial, so that if it is, it not only has no binding force, but the faithful are obliged to resist and refute such a declaration. St. Thomas Aquinas says in his Summa Theologiae: \"If the faith were endangered, a subject ought to rebuke his prelate [pope] even publicly.\" The fact is that this latest promulgation is counter-magisterial, but the pope and his right-hand man now feel they have enough support from the dissenting left that enables them to come forward with it. Cardinal Parolin's rescript on the papal and episcopal documents reads as follows: Rescript \"from an Audience with His Holiness\" The Supreme Pontiff decreed that the two preceding documents be promulgated through publication on the Vatican website and in Acta Apostolicae Sedis, as authentic Magisterium. From the Vatican Palace, on the day of June 5 in the year 2017 Pietro Card. Parolin Secretary of State The Catholic Encyclopedia defines a papal rescript as follows: \"Rescripts are responses of the pope or a Sacred Congregation, in writing, to queries or petitions of individuals. Some rescripts concern the granting of favors; others the administration of justice, e.g. the interpretation of a law.\" It appears then that Parolin's rescript constitutes a direct reply to the dubia of the Four Cardinals. Pope Francis' praise of the episcopal guidelines clearly answers the cardinals' query concerning his intention in Amoris Laetitia VIII, so will Cardinals Brandmuller and Burke now proceed to issue the formal correction of it? As reported in The Dictator Pope\u2014a remarkable new book which provides an inside look at the most tyrannical and unprincipled papacy of recent history\u2014English Cardinal Cormac Murphy O\u2019Connor who was largely responsible for the vote canvassing behind Francis' election told journalist Paul Valley in 2013, \"Four years of Bergoglio would be enough to change things.\" Each day, we see new evidence that this might have been a gross understatement. We shouldn't rule out the possibility that Francis may come forward one day and declare \"ex-cathedra\" that the interpretation of Amoris Laetitia VIII, as now taught by the Holy See, is promulgated as \"extraordinary magisterium.\" Should this happen, the Mystical Body would then be without its head. In an interview with Catholic World Report (CWR) in December 2016, Cardinal Raymond Burke, who is presently a member of the Apostolic Signatura, said that if a pope were to \"formally profess heresy he would cease, by that act, to be the Pope.\" Burke was reiterating Church teaching, as expressed by famed canonist Franz Wernz in his Ius Canonicum: \"In sum, it needs to be said clearly that a [publicly] heretical Roman Pontiff loses his power upon the very fact.\"\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

Over the last few days the alternative media has spent countless hours conducting their own investigations into what actually happened during the mass shooting in Las Vegas that left 59 dead and over 500 injured. From reports of multiple shooters to officials seemingly covering up the ISIS connection, many different theories have been put forth that counter the mainstream narrative. Now, new information released by investigative reporter Laura Loomer proves that authorities have directly lied to the American people about the case at least once by claiming that supposed shooter Stephen Paddock checked into the Mandalay Bay Hotel on September 28th when valet records (with photos) prove he actually arrived three days earlier. According to Loomer, she obtained the image from a source which shows that Paddock\u2019s car first arrived September 25th. The photo even has a handwritten note that was reportedly written by an FBI agent \u2013 proving that the FBI specifically lied to the country. The picture \u201cproves FBI misled public about #StephenPaddock\u2019s check in date,\u201d Loomer Tweeted.

Law enforcement and @FBI misled the public about #Paddock\u2018s check in date and also provided public & media w/ wrong license plate number. pic.twitter.com/y9hS6GqdKI \u2014 Laura Loomer (@LauraLoomer) October 6, 2017 That\u2019s right, photographic evidence from inside the hotel parking garage has confirmed that the FBI, along with state and local police, specifically lied about key details of the shooting. This throws their entire narrative into question and makes one wonder what else is being hidden from the public? Keep in mind that at least four videos from the scene of the shooting have already been released that indicate there were multiple shooters. In fact, there are so many unanswered questions that the Drudge Report even linked to an article asking them directly. As noted above, at this point literally every piece of so-called evidence put forth by authorities and then regurgitated by the mainstream media cannot be trusted and should be considered as disinformation until proven otherwise. And if Paddock really did act alone and this evidence is some sort of mistake, there is surely video footage proving so.

Even though the number of those infected has dropped in recent weeks, the plague will never truly be gone. Since the airborne version of the plague can kill a person in just three hours, experts warn that its too soon to think that since there hasn\u2019t been a person infected in recent days, that it won\u2019t pop up again. That\u2019s because the bacteria that causes plague is now so widespread in wildlife, that humans can\u2019t do anything to get rid of it, said Dr. Allen Cheng, Professor of Infectious Diseases Epidemiology at Monash University in Melbourne. \u201cIt\u2019s not possible to eradicate plague, as it is widespread in wildlife rodents outside the sphere of human influence,\u201d Cheng wrote on The Conversation. \u201cOutbreaks, generally, are managed reactively by \u2018firefighting teams\u2019, deployed to clear houses of fleas, identify and treat cases and give pre-emptive treatment to contacts at risk. A more preventative approach, such as the identification of areas at risk using climate models and animal surveys to focus flea and rat control efforts, would be better,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, this requires a better understanding of transmission pathways in each region where disease persists.\u201d The best way to stop the plague spreading was to focus on flea and rat control in the most at-risk areas, he said. Cheng\u2019s comments came after at least 171 people died in Madagascar over an outbreak of plague. Nine countries were urged by the World Health Organisation (WHO) to prepare for a black death attack, at the end of October. It\u2019s been reported that plague has been transmitted to humans by camels, goats, prairie dogs, rock squirrels and guinea pigs since the 1960\u2019s. There are only a few remaining hotspots for plague in the world \u2013 Madagascar being one of them. This outbreak was also highly \u201cunusual\u201d, in that several different parts of the island were affected, including areas with lots of people. WHO has reported 2119 cases of the plague as of November 10. 171 have died of the disease so far.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

The new allegations came yesterday amid reports that Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) tentatively scheduled a hearing for this Thursday to take testimony from Christine Blasey Ford, 51, who claims Kavanaugh, 53, sexually assaulted her decades ago when he was a high school student. Suspiciously, Ford can\u2019t \u2013or won\u2019t\u2014 say when or where the alleged incident happened and can provide few details. As Paul Sperry writes at the New York Post, working with Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and backed financially by George Soros\u2019s money, Ford\u2019s lawyers spent the last few days gaming the system. After stalling Grassley and getting repeated extensions, the attorneys got the chairman to cave on various demands, such as that Kavanaugh not be in the room when Ford gives evidence. Republicans never seem to learn from their mistakes. As usual, Republicans\u2019 seeming reasonableness is rewarded with more abuse by the Left. Give left-wingers an inch and they\u2019ll take a mile. Democrats, it turns out, used the extra time created through their delaying tactics to produce two new women with questionable claims against Kavanaugh. More accusers could be on their way. President Trump continues to support Kavanaugh, who maintains his innocence. \u201cThis alleged event from 35 years ago did not happen,\u201d the nominee said Sunday of Ford\u2019s accusations. \u201cThe people who knew me then know that this did not happen, and have said so. This is a smear, plain and simple. I look forward to testifying on Thursday about the truth, and defending my good name \u2014 and the reputation for character and integrity I have spent a lifetime building \u2014 against these last-minute allegations.\u201d If Kavanaugh isn\u2019t on the bench on October 1, the Supreme Court will be shorthanded as it begins hearing cases in its new term. The high court normally has a complement of nine justices but with Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy\u2019s retirement July 31, which cleared the way for Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination, there have only been only eight justices in place. Roughly speaking there is a 4-to-4 liberal to conservative ideological split on the court. Democrats would prefer to drag the confirmation process into the next Congress where they stand a good chance of taking control from Republicans. Election Day is November 6. The GOP currently controls the Senate, which has the final say on judicial nominations, by an uncomfortably close margin of 51 to 49. Meanwhile, the New Yorker magazine reported Sunday that Deborah Ramirez, 53, suddenly claims to have been assaulted by Kavanaugh at a drunken party decades ago at Yale College. Ramirez claims Kavanaugh exposed himself to her and brushed his genitals against her. Also on Sunday, media-savvy sleazeball lawyer Michael Avenatti, who represents porn star Stormy Daniels, tweeted that he represents another woman who plans to accuse Kavanaugh of something. \u201cI represent a woman with credible information regarding Judge Kavanaugh and Mark Judge. We will be demanding the opportunity to present testimony to the committee and will likewise be demanding that Judge and others be subpoenaed to testify,\u201d Avenatti wrote on Twitter. \u201cMy client is not Deborah Ramirez.\u201d Washington insiders still believe Kavanaugh will be confirmed, or at least they did before the two new accusers popped up. For example, at a Friday afternoon preview of upcoming cases in the Supreme Court\u2019s approaching October term that was hosted by the Federalist Society, panelist Thomas C. Goldstein of the law firm of Goldstein & Russell predicted that the high court would have nine members again soon. \u201cThere is exactly a zero percent chance that [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell and Chuck Grassley will allow this thing to get past the lame-duck\u201d congressional session after Election Day, said the co-founder of SCOTUSblog who has appeared before the Supreme Court many times. \u201cI think we ought to recognize that. The prospect that the Democrats will take the Senate, albeit thin, is realistic, and so they will do whatever is necessary in order to make sure that there is a ninth member of the court there by the time a Democratic majority could take over in the Senate in January.\u201d We\u2019ll see soon enough if Goldstein\u2019s prediction comes true.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

Palermo, who has done various interviews since the attack, appeared on \u201cThe Blast\u201d with a series of shocking comments that correlate with various other reports indicating that multiple shooters carried out the attack and that the FBI is actively covering this up. \u201cI definitely do believe that there was 100% more than one shooter, every other person that I\u2019ve talked to that did unfortunately get hit as well, have all said the same things,\u201d Palermo detailed. The man then goes on to explain that after being shot he ran \u201cabout 200 yards\u201d to hide behind a car, all the while hearing bullets fly past him at what he believes was ground level. \u201cI\u2019m waiting and all of a sudden we hear a little whizzing going by us, all of a sudden bullets are just flying by,\u201d he continued. \u201cWhen something is coming up and down or at least from a different angle they are either going to hit the ground or\u2026 alot of different things are going to happen. When someone is shooting form a horizontal line its just going to keep shooting,\u201d Palermo attempted to explain. Take note that what he means here is that people were being shot at from ground level rather than the 32nd floor of the hotel. Palermo then specifically heard the gun shots get \u201ccloser and closer\u201d before quickly deciding it was once again time to run. Shockingly, he then goes on to detail the fact that at the end of the concert the previous two nights everyone had exited a specific way but on the night of the shooting this route was locked down shortly before the attack. \u201cEvery other night at the concert, everybody kinda exited right off Las Vegas Blvd, that was standard, that was routine, you get out of the concert and you go down to the next casino,\u201d he continued. \u201cAt 10pm they closed every exit on Las Vegas Blvd, every single one. They gated them all closed with chain-link fences, 10:08 the shooting started and we were pigs sitting in a corral. We only had one exit to go out of\u2026..everyone was just kinda following the sheep.\u201d Palermo makes clear this confused concert goers who had used the normal exits in the past. \u201cThe same exits we had came in and left Friday and Saturday night were definitely closed. There were people that went over there and tried to leave and there were cops that were telling them no, you can\u2019t go out here, you have to go the other way,\u201d he shockingly concluded. This stunning testimony is obviously a huge bombshell in the ongoing investigation of the Las Vegas mass shooting and is sure to continue to add credence to the growing belief that we are not being told what actually happened that fateful night.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

A report released by Republican senators on the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigation said the Obama administration didn't tell Congress that it sought access for Iran and, in its eagerness to clinch the nuclear deal, was trying to dodge sanctions that remained in place following the 2016 agreement. \"The Obama administration misled the American people and Congress because they were desperate to get a deal with Iran,\" said Sen. Rob Portman, the Ohio Republican who chairs the subcommittee and opposed the Iran deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. The accusations were rejected by Obama administration officials who said Republicans are trying to make a one-time effort to meet obligations under the nuclear deal sound like an attempt to give Iran broad access to the US financial system. They said the Republican senators never interviewed former Obama administration officials involved, and noted that no Democrats were involved. The story \"is widely overblown,\" said Jarrett Blanc, the former State Department coordinator for Iran deal implementation at the State Department. Iran deal reverberations The report and the former officials' response highlight how controversial the Iran deal continues to be, even after President Donald Trump's May 8 decision to leave the international pact. That move continues to roil relations with European allies who are sticking with the Iran deal. They appealed to the US on Wednesday to exempt them from sanctions as they continue to do business with Tehran. But one goal behind report's release, according to an official familiar with its contents, is to make clear that the US is not likely to be open to exemptions of any kind. \"As the United States begins to re-impose sanctions on Iran and Iranian entities, our European allies must understand and appreciate that doing business with Iran is no longer permissible,\" the source said. The report focuses on $5.7 billion from Iranian oil sales that were frozen in Oman's Bank Muscat in that country's currency, the rial. Rials are pegged to the US dollar and are difficult to convert. But as part of the nuclear deal, Iran was promised access to overseas reserves of its own funds that had been frozen by sanctions. To access the rials, Iran wanted to convert them briefly into dollars and then Euros. JUST WATCHED Bolton: US will impose all pre-deal Iran sanctions Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Bolton: US will impose all pre-deal Iran sanctions 03:05 The majority report by the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigation says that the US Treasury, at the instruction of the US State Department, granted a license to convert the $5.7 billion briefly into American dollars so it could be converted into euros. The exchange was legal, the report notes. Officials at Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control asked two US banks to work as intermediaries and execute the transaction, but they declined, citing concern over potential regulatory backlash and a ding to their reputations. Emails reviewed in the investigation show that OFAC officials worked to encourage banks to take part in the deal by proposing to bring in senior officials. \"I agree it would be a good idea to have (Treasury Secretary Jack) Lew engage (the US bank). If they refuse we can suggest (Secretary of State John) Kerry will call, which will drive them nuts,\" an email from a US government official said. After Treasury officials were examining whether the Iran deal's relevant sanctions permit currency exchange of rials to dollars, the report says a Treasury official wrote in an email, \"Yikes. It looks like we committed to a whole lot beyond just allowing the immobilized funds to settle out.\" A legal transaction But in the end, Treasury officials concluded that the transaction was legal. The report said they decided that the terms of the JCPOA were \"consistent with Iran's position, allowing the Government of Iran to engage in 'transfers,' 'foreign exchange (including Rial related transactions),' and the 'purchase or acquisition by the Government of Iran of US bank notes.'\" The source familiar with the report said that Congress asked the Obama administration directly about such a license, but that the administration was under no legal obligation to provide the licenses to Congress. The Republican report argues that in pushing for the license to go forward, Obama officials were violating financial and oil-related sanctions imposed on Iran stemming from the seizure of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979 and trying to give Iran access to the US financial system. They pointed to a number of Obama officials, including Lew, who said in congressional testimony that Iran was not granted access to the US financial system. Lew said in 2015 that Iran \"will continue to be denied access to the [US's] financial and commercial market.\" Treasury's acting under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence during the Obama administration, Adam Szubin, claimed that \"Iranian banks will not be able to clear US dollars through New York, hold correspondent account relationships with US financial institutions, or enter into financing arrangements with US banks.\" JUST WATCHED Pompeo lays out US list of demands for Iran Replay More Videos ...

            "question": "Which of the following tactics is used in the following text?\n\nArticle: Austrian diocese blesses gay couples on Valentine\u2019s Day, makes reference to Amoris Laetitia NewsCatholic Church, Homosexuality AUSTRIA, February 16, 2018 (LifeSiteNews) \u2013 The Diocese of Linz, Austria, invited homosexual couples to participate in the blessing of couples on St. Valentine's Day. The move comes in the wake of the recent debate over the German bishops' initiative to bless homosexual couples, as well as the controversy over Bishop Andreas Laun's own criticism of it. The diocese\u2019s own media report makes a reference to Amoris Laetitia, as well as to Cardinal Reinhard Marx's recent initiative. The official diocesan newspaper, KirchenZeitung, announced on February 9 that in two different parishes in the Diocese of Linz homosexual couples were explicitly invited to receive a Church blessing on St. Valentine's Day. As is explained in the article: St. Valentine is known as the saint of friendship and of love. In many parishes and ecclesial institutions, it is already tradition to offer blessings of couples around the time of his feast day. People in homosexual relationships are welcome at the blessing ceremonies in Wels-St. Franziskus [Church] and in the Ursulinenkirche. Paul St\u00fctz, the author of the article, explains that the blessing of couples \u201coffers an occasion to express love.\u201d \u201cThe blessing expresses that one is welcomed by one's partner and by God.\u201d At the end of his article, he adds a link to another report about Cardinal Reinhard Marx's recent 3 February interview showing his openness to the idea of blessings of homosexual couples in individual cases as decided by a pastor. St\u00fctz also quotes in the article itself Father Franz Harant, \u201ca pastoral worker in the field of marriage and the family\u201d at the Ursulinenkirche in Linz. Harant himself shows himself a supporter of blessings for homosexual couples, and he makes here an explicit reference to Amoris Laetitia. As St\u00fctz reports: We give out that universally available blessing. There, we have nothing to forbid,\u201d says Harant. He sees himself in this in union with Pope Francis who himself says in his magisterial document Amoris Laetitia that \u201ceach person, independent of his sexual orientation, is to be respected in his dignity and welcomed with respect. As the Austrian Catholic website Kath.net writes, Harant must be quoting here AL 250. Irmgard Lehner, the pastoral assistant of the Wels-St. Franziskus Church, the other of the two parishes that welcome homosexual couples, appreciates this blessing ritual for Valentine's Day, saying it has \u201can enormous power.\u201d During the ceremony, couples come forward in church and receive a hand on their foreheads and a sign of the cross. \u201cWe thus stress the high value of relationships,\u201d explains Lehner. As the KirchenZeitung journalist adds: \u201cThis offer can be accepted by lovers in all kinds of life situations \u2013 also by lesbians and homosexuals.\u201d Lehner, who is herself a theologian, regrets that, so far, no homosexual couple has come for the blessing. \u201cHere with us, everybody should feel welcome, just as he or she is.\u201d The pastoral assistant adds that \u201cGod is love. There are no restrictions.\u201d The Diocesan Working Group on Pastoral Care for Homosexuals (dahop) is rejoicing about such a welcome from a parish. The group says that it repeatedly receives requests from homosexual couples who wish to \u201creceive a blessing in the frame of a liturgy.\u201d The KirchenZeitung then quotes a commentary, saying: It would be good if a clear sign of openness and invitation would be made by many more pastoral workers [male and female], in order to give the clear signal that love between two persons with equal rights are wished by God and thus already blessed. Moreover, the above-quoted Franz Harant himself is the contact person of this Diocesan Working Group \u2013 also called \u201cRainbow Pastoral.\u201d As can be seen on the website of dahop, the Diocese of Linz offers special liturgical services for homosexuals, called \u201cQueer Church Services\u201d (Queer-Gottesdienste) that take place in Harant's own parish. It is not clear whether these church services take place in a form of a Holy Mass. Similar blessings for homosexual couples are currently taking place, or are being considered, also in Gemany, some of them on the diocesan level, some of them on an individual level. As LifeSiteNews reported in January, the Diocese of Limburg is publicly discussing the establishment of a special liturgical rite for the blessing of homosexuals. Publicly presented by Johannes zu Eltz, a high-ranking priest of the diocese, his so-called Frankfurt proposal has the public support of the local bishop, Georg B\u00e4tzing. Additionally, the Austrian Catholic website Kath.net reports that there are two Catholics priests in two different German dioceses who publicly state now to have given many blessings to homosexual couples. Father Christoph Simonsen (Diocese of Aachen) says that he has blessed 50 couples in the last fifteen years; Father Siegfried Modenbach (Archdiocese of Paderborn) has blessed two homosexual couples in the last years. He also conducts church services for homosexuals. Kath.net subsequently contacted both Dioceses and requested information about these two priests. As an answer, they were told that the Diocese intends to talk with the concerned priests, but that this matter needs to be addressed among the German bishops in general, such as in the German Bishops' Conference. This moral turmoil in German dioceses has provoked concern and criticism among Catholics. Mathias von Gersdorff, German pro-life activist and book author, states on his own blog, the upcoming Spring Assembly of the German Bishops' Conference will become crucial in this matter. As he sees it, \u201cthe bishops of Germany who will meet next week for the Spring Assembly of the Bishops' Conference find themselves in a complicated situation,\u201d where they will have to show their colors. They will either be in favor of the Catholic Church's teaching on sexuality and marriage and forbid such blessings, or \u201cessentially accept them,\u201d at least by \u201csaying nothing.\u201d He concludes:\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

As part of its purge, Facebook has removed the pages of several police accountability/watchdog/critic groups, including Cop Block, the Free Thought Project, and Police the Police.

What makes this recent purge from Facebook and Twitter so egregious is that the pages like the Free Thought Project, the Anti-Media, Press for Truth, and dozens of others, did not fit the hate speech narrative these same companies used to wipe out Alex Jones. Instead, these pages were dedicated to spreading peace, bridging the divide, bringing humanity together and holding government accountable. And how does this poem end, again? https://t.co/nUZ82x9JFt \u2014 Anya Parampil (@anyaparampil) August 6, 2018 The purge happened around 12:30 p.m. CST with mainstream news reports launching at the same time \u2014 implying that they were given the heads up about the move. In a statement co-authored by Facebook Head of Cybersecurity Nathaniel Gleicher \u2014 who Caitlin Johnstone aptly points out, also happens to be the former White House National Security Council Director of Cybersecurity Policy \u2014 the massive social media platform explained that it has removed \u201c559 Pages and 251 accounts that have consistently broken our rules against spam and coordinated inauthentic behavior.\u201d Facebook said the pages were \u201cworking to mislead others about who they are, and what they are doing.\u201d However, this couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. Our names, addresses, and phone numbers were on all of our pages and our profiles. \u201cWe were verified by Facebook with a little check mark next to our name, so they know we are a legitimate organization/outlet. They have seen our \u201cArticles of Organization\u201d which was issued by the state of Louisiana, which is where my partner and The Free Thought Project co-founder lives,\u201d Jason Bassler, co-founder of the Free Thought Project explained. However, in their statement, Facebook then suggested the real reason behind the purge \u2014 elections are coming \u2014 and pesky folks like the independent media have a way of reporting information on candidates that the mainstream tends to ignore \u2014 like war, corruption, and most recently, Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s disdain for the Constitution. \u201cGiven the activity we\u2019ve seen \u2014 and its timing ahead of the US midterm elections \u2014 we wanted to give some details about the types of behavior that led to this action,\u201d Facebook said, before accusing us of hawking fake products or functioning as ad farms that tricked \u201cpeople into thinking that they were forums for legitimate political debate.\u201d It should be stated that TFTP never hid the fact that we worked with other independent media groups to share our information around the web \u2014 this is the very definition of grassroots. But all of us together certainly posed a threat to the mainstream so this nonsense about tricking people was brought into play. Within all of our pages under the Free Thought umbrella, we had close to 6 million followers. Does Facebook think it knows better than the 6 million people who clicked like on our page? We also had close to 16,000 reviews on our page with an average 4.1 star rating, directly showing that people desired to see what we were putting out. The only ones manipulating people here are the tech giants themselves. All but proving the case that this was a coordinated attack by the tech giant community, shortly after the purge on Facebook, Twitter followed suit, wiping out our profiles on there as well. They gave absolutely no reason for the suspension. \u201cThis signifies a re-consolidation of the media. Cable news media controlled the narrative for most of modern history, but the internet has lowered that barrier to entry and allowed the average person to become the media themselves. This obviously took market share and influence away from the traditional media, and it has allowed for a more diverse public conversation. Now it seems the platforms that have monopolized the industry are favoring mainstream sources and silencing alternative voices. So now, instead of allowing more people to have a voice, these platforms are creating an atmosphere where only powerful media organizations are welcome, just as we had on cable news,\u201d John Vibes poignantly noted. The bottom line is that sites like ours and the others who were wiped from the internet yesterday represent a voice against the plutocratic information-controlling establishment. We challenge their paradigm of control and this is a thorn in their side. There are no longer distinct lines between social media giants and government either which renders the \u201cthey are private, they can do what they wish\u201d argument moot. Facebook has been partnering with the Digital Forensics Lab, an arm of the Atlantic Council think tank \u2014 a neoconservative group funded by Gulf monarchies, defense giants like Raytheon, megabanks like HSBC, foreign state actors, and the US government \u2014 to weed out people like us who challenge the status quo.

Jesus Campos, who the narrative is constantly changing around, is still a source of mystery. So who is Jesus Campos? That burning question has bothered many since the release of his name, but there\u2019s been no photograph of this alleged hero, even though we\u2019ve already seen crime scene images of the guns Stephen Paddock allegedly dragged up to his 32nd-floor hotel room. The ever-changing narrative now though, seems to swirl around this unknown mystery security guard. At first, Campos, a guard at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, was hailed a hero for helping guide police to gunman Stephen Paddock\u2019s room on the 32nd floor. Police said Campos was shot in the leg at the end of Paddock\u2019s assault on concertgoers\u2014potentially distracting the gunman and causing him to panic and kill himself. But now, questions have been raised after Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo revised the timeline and said Campos had actually been shot about 9:59 p.m. a (full six minutes before the mass shooting began at 10:05 p.m.) which means the guard could have instead led Paddock to start opening fire on the crowd for fear of being caught. Police have said it was difficult to identify the source of the bullets during the attack, and the confusion added more minutes to their lengthy response. But the revised timeline shows officers would have known where Paddock was before the mass shooting even started. Did Campos call 911? What happened during those six minutes? Much of Campos\u2019s story and background remains a mystery. \u2013Newsweek Campos\u2019s co-worker Liliana Rodriguez started a GoFundMe account for him on October 3, explaining that he\u2019d been shot while on \u201crandom patrol\u201d and it could have been anyone of us. \u201cFunds will be used to provide relief and financial support for him while he gets back on his feet,\u201d Rodriguez\u2019s online petition says. \u201cThis is a young man that I work with day in and day out. Any financial support would be appreciated for the time he would need to recover.\u201d Strangely, a picture of Campos wasn\u2019t displayed as part of the fund because Rodriguez indicated that \u201cdue to privacy from the media we do not feel comfortable publishing a photo.\u201d There are obviously certain things that the FBI and other investigators seem intent on covering up. Their own narrative is quickly shattering. Las Vegas Metro Police Undersheriff Kevin McMahill explained more about Campos\u2019s actions the night of the shooting, helping fill in some of what happened ahead of the attack, but unfortunately, it only added more questions and gave little in the way of answers. McMahill told KNPR, a local NPR affiliate, that Campos went up to the 32nd floor to investigate a door alarm. While on the 32nd floor, he found that a stairwell door was jammed and radioed down to maintenance. Campos heard a drilling sound and thought it was odd. A maintenance worker came up to the 32nd floor. As the pair started talking, Paddock began firing through the door of his room, first with a single-fire gun and then with a rapid-fire rifle. Police have said that when Campos radioed what happened, it helped them track where Paddock was holed up \u2013 so why change the narrative to make it even more unbelievable? And still, none of this explains why Campos is not registered as a security guard either, and why the timeline is being changed publically. What exactly do they want us to believe?

            "question": "Which of the following tactics is used in the following text?\n\nArticle: The Cunning CIA Whatever else might be said about the assassination of President Kennedy, one thing is for sure: The cover-up of this particular U.S. regime-change operation was one of the most ingenious and cunning plots ever designed. This shouldn\u2019t surprise anyone, given that practically from its inception in 1947 the CIA was specializing in the arts of assassination, regime change, and cover-up. As far back as 1953, the CIA published an assassination manual that the CIA succeeded in keeping secret from the American people for more than 40 years. It came to light in 1997 as a result of a Freedom of Information request. That was around the time that the Assassination Records Review Board, which was overseeing the mandatory release of JFK-related assassination records of the CIA and other federal agencies that had been kept secret from the American people since 1963. Today, Americans can read the CIA\u2019s assassination manual online. Titled \u201cStudy of Assassination,\u201d the manual spells out various ways to assassinate people. Here is what the manual states in part regarding the use of firearms: Firearms are often used in assassination, often very ineffectively\u2026. Public figures or guarded officials may be killed with great reliability and some safety if a firing point can be established prior to an official occasion. The propaganda value of this system may be very high. Time to buy old US gold coins The manual also makes it clear that the CIA was studying ways to assassinate people without being detected. Note the following excerpt: For secret assassination, either simple or chase, the contrived accident is the most effective technique. When successfully executed, it causes little excitement and is only casually investigated. It would be safe to assume that the CIA continued developing and expanding on the assassination principles enunciated in that early assassination manual. That\u2019s what we would expect from an agency whose specialties included assassination. We can also assume that the CIA continued to refine the ways to avoid detection when assassinating someone. The Kennedy Autopsy Jacob G Hornberger Best Price: $9.85 Buy New $9.95 (as of 03:35 EDT - Details) The CIA published that secret assassination manual as part of its preparations for a U.S. regime-change operation in Guatemala, one that was designed to violently remove the nation\u2019s democratically elected socialist president, Jacobo Arbenz, from office and replace him with an unelected, right-wing, pro-U.S. military general. As part of the Guatemala regime-change operation, the CIA prepared a list of Guatemalan officials to be assassinated. While the CIA has never revealed the names of the people it targeted for assassination, there is little doubt that Arbenz, the president, was at the top of the list. There is something important to note: Neither Arbenz nor any other Guatemalan official had ever attacked the United States or even threatened to do so. So, why were they targeted for assassination? Because Arbenz had reached out to the Russians and Cubans in a spirit of peace and friendship, just as John Kennedy would do ten years later. That\u2019s why the CIA targeted Guatemala for regime change and why it targeted Arbenz and other Guatemalan officials for assassination. Although Arbenz was able to escape the country, the CIA\u2019s regime-change operation was a total success, with Arbenz being replaced by the pro-U.S. Gen. Carlos Castillo Armas, who proceeded to instigate a reign of terror across Guatemala. The Guatemalan operation was brilliant and ingenious. The CIA officials were secretly honored for protecting \u201cnational security\u201d by removing President Arbenz from office and replacing him with a pro-U.S. military general. Tracy Barnes, one of the CIA officials responsible for the operation, was awarded the Distinguished Intelligence Medal, the CIA\u2019s second-highest medal. The CIA\u2019s cover-up in the JFK assassination was even more brilliant and ingenious. The doctors at Parkland Hospital stated that President Kennedy had a big exit-sized wound in the back of his head, which implied a shot having been fired from the front. At a press conference immediately after the president died, two treating physicians stated that the other wound \u2014 the one in the front of Kennedy\u2019s neck \u2014 was an entry wound, which implied that Kennedy had been hit by another shot fired from the front. This necessarily meant that Kennedy had been shot from the front, not the rear, where accused assassin Lee Harvey Oswald was situated. Keep in mind something important: After he was arrested, Oswald claimed his innocence. But he also went a step further. He said that he was being framed for the crime. The obvious question arises: Why frame an innocent man who is situated in the rear by killing the president with shots fired from the front? Wouldn\u2019t it be more logical to either have the shots fired from the rear, where Oswald was, or, alternatively, place Oswald in the front, where the shots were fired? That\u2019s where the brilliance, ingenuity, and cunningness of the cover-up come into play. If Oswald is in the rear and since shots are fired from the front, that could mean only one thing: that Oswald had confederates firing from the front. Who would those confederates be? There could be only one answer: communists. Soviet and Cuban communists, to be more specific. How would we know this? That\u2019s where Oswald\u2019s trip to Mexico City right before the assassination comes into play. Regime Change: The JFK... Jacob Hornberger Check Amazon for Pricing. Oswald traveled to Mexico City where he purportedly visited the Soviet and Cuban embassies and where he supposedly met with a premier assassin for the Soviet Union. Keep in mind that this was the height of the Cold War between the United States and that the Cuban Missile Crisis, which brought the world to the brink of nuclear war, had taken place the previous year. So, President Kennedy has been assassinated. Oswald is immediately arrested. He has confederates firing from the front, who almost certainly are Soviet and Cuban communists, especially since Oswald\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

One hopes the rumor mill is wrong. Longtime Geller Report readers have suffered Powell for well over a decade. Dina Habib Powell is a deep part of the Republican establishment. She is part of the swamp, part of the willfully ignorant McMaster crowd that clearly opposed Trump\u2019s agenda. Back in 2017, she resigned her post of Deputy National Security Adviser NSC under Islamic apologist H. R. McMaster, whose failed views she shared. McMaster subscribed to the Obama view that Islamic terrorism has nothing to do with Islam, despite the numerous Islamic texts and teachings that incite Muslims to wage war against unbelievers. McMaster went so far as to claim that devout jihadis were \u201cirreligious.\u201d take our poll - story continues below Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?

McMaster forced out superb K.T. McFarland from her role as Deputy National Security Advisor and inserted Dina Habib-Powell, former Bush gatekeeper whose pals included Huma Abedin and Valerie Jarrett. When President Trump finally replaced national security adviser H.R. McMaster with John Bolton, it was the much-needed correction to the failed incoherent foreign policy of the Obama era. Why would President Trump go back to there? Needless to say, the Never Trumpers are. When visiting Egypt, Habib-Powell had assured the locals of how Bush, after September 11, \u201cvisited a mosque, took off his shoes and paid his respects.\u201d \u201cI see the president talk of Islam as a religion of peace, I see him host an iftar every year,\u201d she gushed. K.T. McFarland had written that \u201cGlobal Islamist jihad is at war with all of Western civilization.\u201d It\u2019s not hard to see why McMaster pushed out McFarland and elevated Habib-Powell. Habib-Powell had attended the Iftar dinner with members of Muslim Brotherhood front groups. You can see her photographed at the American Task Force of Palestine gala. The ATFP was originally Rashid Khalidi\u2019s American Committee on Jerusalem. She was there as a presenter at the Middle East Institute after a speech by Hanan Ashrawi. Her achievements under Bush included cultural exchanges with Iran, as well as cash for the Palestinian Authority and for Lebanon after the Hezbollah war with Israel. While President Trump fights to restrict Muslim immigration, at his side is the woman who had once bragged onCNN, \u201cOver 90% of student visas are now issued in under a week, and that is in the Middle East.\u201d (CFP) Is it any wonder Habib Powell was a major White House source of the negative leaks to the enemedia? Two separate National Security Council sources have confirmed that National Security Advisor H. R. McMaster and Deputy National Security Advisor Dina Powell have been leaking negative material about President Donald J. Trump to their allies in the anti-Trump media, Daniel Greenfield said this about Dina Habib Powell: \u201cThe media dubbed her the Republican Huma Abedin. She\u2019s been one of the most powerful women in two Republican administrations. She\u2019s friends with Valerie Jarrett\u2026.Habib Powell had all the right friends. Like Valerie Jarrett. Arianna Huffington praised the White House for bringing her in. Her ex-husband heads up Teneo Strategy: the organization created by the same man who made the Clinton Foundation happen and which employed Huma Abedin. You could see her posing next to Huma, Arianna and a Saudi princess. You can see her photographed at the American Task Force of Palestine gala. The ATFP was originally Rashid Khalidi\u2019s American Committee on Jerusalem. Khalidi was the former PLO spokesman at the center of the Obama tape scandal. And Habib Powell was there as a presenter at the Middle East Institute after a speech by the PLO\u2019s Hanan Ashrawi\u2026.Dina Habib Powell is a deep part of the Republican establishment. Her top role at the NSC represents McMaster\u2019s vision for our approach to Islam. And it\u2019s an echo of the failed approach of the Bush years. Flynn made the NSC into a tool that matched Trump\u2019s vision. McMaster is remaking it to match Jeb Bush\u2019s vision.\u201d Powell has close ties to the Clintons. Breitbart: 1 \u2013 When she served as president of the Goldman Sachs Foundation, the philanthropic arm of the Wall Street giant, Powell repeatedly partnered with the Clinton Global Initiative for a globalist women\u2019s project that served as the centerpiece of Goldman\u2019s foundation. 2 \u2013 Powell\u2019s organization joined with the Clinton Global Initiative for globalist giving projects. 3 \u2013 Powell\u2019s Goldman Sachs fund directly donated to the controversial Clinton Foundation. 4 \u2013 Powell\u2019s Goldman Sachs group worked with Hillary Clinton\u2019s State Department in a project announced by Clinton. 5 \u2013 Powell was a featured speaker at a Clinton Global Initiative event alongside Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton\u2019s former campaign chief, John Podesta. On May 11, 2009, Powell was one of ten speakers at a Clinton Global Initiative event co-sponsored with the Economist titled, \u201cGlobal Challenges, Corporate Solutions: Creating Value for Business and Society.\u201d Other speakers included Bill Clinton and Clinton\u2019s former chief of staff, John Podesta, who at the time was president and chief executive officer of the George Soros-financed Center for American Progress and co-chairman of the Obama White House transition team. Podesta would later become chairman of Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign. Powell also served as a panelist at the second annual Women in the World Summit in 2011,\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

WASHINGTON \u2014 Attorney General Jeff Sessions has a message for Donald Trump: You\u2019re wrong, Mr. President. Sessions long has been one of Trump\u2019s favorite pinatas, often taking the brunt of the president\u2019s public scorn. Trump offered this assessment of his hand-picked attorney general recusing himself from the Justice Department\u2019s special counsel probe of Russian election meddling: \u201cWhat kind of man is this?\u201d Trump, in an interview that aired Thursday morning, also blasted Sessions because, he said, the former Alabama senator \u201cnever took control of the Justice Department.\u201d About seven hours later, the country\u2019s top law enforcement officer fired back. And, by doing so, took on Trump publicly in a way few Republicans in Washington have during his turbulent 19-month-old presidency. \u201cI took control of the Department of Justice the day I was sworn in, which is why we have had unprecedented success at effectuating the President\u2019s agenda \u2014 one that protects the safety and security and rights of the American people, reduces violent crime, enforces our immigration laws, promotes economic growth, and advances religious liberty,\u201d the AG said in a statement. \u201cWhile I am Attorney General, the actions of the Department of Justice will not be improperly influenced by political considerations. I demand the highest standards, and where they are not met, I take action,\u201d Sessions added. \u201cHowever, no nation has a more talented, more dedicated group of law enforcement investigators and prosecutors than the United States.\u201d That last statement comes amid nearly constant complaints from Trump that Justice Department and FBI investigators are being unfair to the president and his allies. That line of criticism has been picked up by, among others, Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., who was indicted on federal officials this week on charges of misusing campaign finance funds for personal use. Trump did not directly answer a Fox News interviewer\u2019s question about whether he intends to fire Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who is overseeing the special counsel investigation, after November\u2019s congressional elections. He also said he only gave the former senator the job because Sessions was a supporter during the 2016 presidential race. \u2014 John T.

The ruling has no basis in the Constitution, mind you. USA Today reported on the ruling: WASHINGTON \u2013 A federal judge on Friday ordered the White House to restore CNN reporter Jim Acosta\u2019s press badge, which had been revoked earlier this month after a contentious exchange at a news conference with President Donald Trump. U.S. District Court Judge Timothy Kelly, a Trump appointee, said the White House had violated Acosta\u2019s Fifth Amendment right to due process by suspending his press badge without explanation or a chance for CNN to appeal the decision. Kelly said White House officials couldn\u2019t say who made the decision or how. The judge ordered the government to restore the credential while the rest of the case \u2013 which drew a slew of support from other media outlets, including USA TODAY \u2013 is argued. \u201cThis court cannot restore Mr. Acosta\u2019s access to press briefings that have already been held,\u201d Kelly said. But Kelly said he hasn\u2019t considered at all yet whether the White House violated Acosta\u2019s First Amendment rights. More arguments are expected Tuesday. \u201cI trust this litigation will continue at a rapid pace.\u201d Kelly said. What? Due process? Wait, Acosta was not charged with a crime. Neither his property, liberty nor his life was taken. There is no due process here. take our poll - story continues below Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?

Nope, not gonna happen. Because it's not a right. Yet, this judge orders the White House to restore the credentials? Give me a break! Acosta's First Amendment rights weren't violated either. Furthermore, the White House did say they were willing to have another reporter in to the White House press from CNN, but that just wasn't good enough. CNN tweeted: \"Statement from CNN and @ Acosta on today\u2019s ruling: \u201cWe are gratified with this result and we look forward to a full resolution in the coming days.

President Trump responded to the order. He told Fox News' Chris Wallace, \"Yeah, its fine, I mean it\u2019s not a big deal. What they said, though, is that we have to create rules and regulations for conduct etc. etc. We\u2019re doing that, were going to write them up right now. It\u2019s not a big deal and if he misbehaves, we\u2019ll throw him out or we\u2019ll stop the news conference.\" In speaking about the rules and regulations the White House is writing up, Trump added, \"We\u2019re writing them now. We\u2019ll have rules of decorum, you know you can\u2019t keep asking questions. We had a lot of reporters in that room, many many reporters in that room and they were unable to ask questions because this guy gets up and starts, you know, doing what he\u2019s supposed to be doing for him and for CNN and you know just shouting out questions and making statements, too.\" You know that isn't going to stop someone like Acosta, who claimed to deal in facts and truth, but clearly demonstrated he was all about lies when it came to putting his hands on a White House aide. The order by Judge Kelly is a temporary one that lasts for 14 days. \u201cI will say this, look, nobody believes in the First Amendment more than I do and if I think somebody is acting out of sorts I will leave,\" Trump continued. \"I will say thank you very much everybody, I appreciate you coming and I\u2019ll leave. And those reporters will not be too friendly to whoever it is that\u2019s acting up.\u201d White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders issued a statement following the judge's ruling on Thursday. \u201cToday, the court made clear that there is no absolute First Amendment right to access the White House. In response to the court, we will temporarily reinstate the reporter\u2019s hard pass. We will also further develop rules and processes to ensure fair and orderly press conferences in the future. There must be decorum at the White House.\u201d Well, I can't wait to see the next press conference. Perhaps there is an easier way around all of this.

It was the victory of Islamic law over Western law, sharia over freedom. This because Trump retweeted three videos showing Muslims being violent. Bryant, a former Foreign Office minister, supported this madness by pointing to\u2026me. He cited the cases of two U.S. far-right bloggers, Pamela Geller and Robert Spencer, who were banned by May in 2013 from entering the U.K. I was going to be among a group of freedom-fighters \u2013 a true rainbow coalition of human rights activists from all over the world (a Hindu princess had been set to join us) \u2013 to honor the memory of Lee Rigby, the British soldier who had been murdered on a London street in broad daylight by an Islamic jihadist on May 22, 2013. We planned to pay our respects to Lee Rigby by placing a wreath at his memorial, in his memory and in memory of his service. We planned to bring the Stars and Stripes, as well as British and Danish flags, and participate in Armed Forces Day memorial commemorations at the Royal Artillery Barracks in Woolwich, where Rigby served. For this, we were banned. When Prime Minister Theresa May, who was the head of the Home Office when she banned us and was thus directly responsible for the ban, threw us under the bus in order to satiate savages who threatened violence, did she really think she or anyone would be safe? Safe by surrender? When did they ever work in the history of humankind? The \u00fcber-left pol citing the Geller-Spencer ban in the U.K. to ban Trump was inevitable. It\u2019s like the Geller ban on ads on buses and subways in every major American city: the Catholic Church just tried to run ads on buses in Washington, D.C., and discovered that it couldn\u2019t because of the ban on all political ads that was enacted in order to prevent my ads from running. Once you sanction the silencing and persecution of one, inevitably, you\u2019ve sanctioned it for all. It\u2019s open season on the opposition. Who decides what\u2019s good and what\u2019s forbidden in a totalitarian society? The totalitarians. The worldwide howl at Trump\u2019s retweets of videos tweeted out by a British politician is further proof of the Islamization of the West. It speaks to how deeply and far and widely sharia has been normed and accepted by Western elites. The videos in the retweets are authentic and have circulated for years. They\u2019re neither \u201cfar-right\u201d nor \u201cIslamophobic\u201d; they\u2019re just factual. Once again the media are blaming the messenger instead of dealing with Islamic violence. Trump didn\u2019t add any rhetoric to his tweets. He retweeted authentic videos. (The Dutch media now claim that one of them doesn\u2019t depict Muslim migrants being violent, as was claimed. Even if this is true, Muslim migrant violence is a grim and increasingly common reality in Europe.) If Muslims sincerely condemn jihad terror and sharia oppression, they shouldn\u2019t oppose him. In a letter to May, Bryant wrote: \u201cI am writing to you to ask you and the home secretary to take immediate action to ban the president of the United States, Donald Trump, from entering the United Kingdom, due to his apparent support for far-right groups in this country. In retweeting Jayda Fransen\u2019s posts, it is absolutely clear to me that President Trump is supporting and condoning fascism and far-right activity. This activity has frequently taken the form of violence on our streets. Ms Fransen herself has a long history of racism and Islamophobia, some of it criminal. Many of the people you have rightly banned from entering the UK were guilty of less than this.\u201d \u201cFascism.\u201d By that Bryant means \u201cdefending British values.\u201d While admitting numerous jihad preachers, Britain is keeping out the voices of sanity that would call that nation back to a path that would secure freedom for her children and her children\u2019s children instead of a path to national suicide. And now a call to ban the president of the nation that saved their nation from extinction not 70 years ago. The full story of my being banned from the UK for standing against jihad, and much more, is in my new book, FATWA: Hunted in America . Get the book. Buy it for friends. Educate those around you.

No one should be surprised by the crackdown on illegals entering the country, especially since it was one of the major campaign promises Donald Trump made before getting elected. When it comes to the separation of children from their families, there is nothing new today that was not being done during the Obama reign. In 2013, Obama began bringing into the US literally over a hundred thousand people, mainly below age 21. They were bused, flown, and met at the US border with Mexico by the Department of Homeland Security under the direction of Obama to do so. Since most of them were adolescents and older teenagers they could not be set free, thus Obama ordered various military bases to house these children. take our poll - story continues below Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician? Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician? Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician? * Dianne Feinstein Maxine Waters Adam Schiff Chuck Schumer Kamala Harris Kirsten Gillibrand Keith Ellison Cory Booker Email * Comments This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged. Completing this poll grants you access to Freedom Outpost updates free of charge. You may opt out at anytime. You also agree to this site's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use. The surge of children into the US from various countries south of the border was said to be the result of economics, high crime rates, and actual threats from organized crime entities. Another excuse used by the Obama government was to bring them here to find their families already in the US. Thus, the idea that separating children from their parents as being something new, done only by the Trump Administration is absurd, since we really have no idea whether the children brought here during the Obama reign were intentionally separated from their parents by the US government at that time, or not. We have only what little information the government told us then, which was not very much, considering the fact that Obama wanted to keep as much of this situation as secret as possible. What many do not realize is, today's policy of separating underage siblings from their parents once they cross the border illegally into the US seems to be a planned event by the US government going all the way back to the domestic military exercises known as Jade Helm in 2015. Many remember the military taking over several Walmart locations, mainly in Texas, during the Jade Helm exercises. This, along with the federal government grab of millions of acres of land during the Obama years, speaks volumes in the government's plan to be able to handle millions of people. Since Obama planned to have over a million Muslim refugees brought into the US over a short period of time, along with the hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants coming in, one can understand the reason the Feds had to have the Walmart stores and so much land, as they needed housing for the millions they planned to bring in. Despite President Trump signing an Executive Order suspending Syrian refugees from entering the US for 120 days on Jan. 26, 2017 while security measures were reviewed, the US still imported 110,000 refugees from Syria and various other countries into the US in 2017 alone, up from 85,000 the previous year. These numbers follow Obama's projections of the expected amount of refugees permitted to come to the US. Of course, as with the number of illegal immigrants entering our county, the Feds downplay the actual number which always ends up to be more than quadruple their stated number. What we seem to have here with the illegal immigration situation today is some very good actors on the Left accusing the Trump Administration of being cruel and insensitive with separating children from their families once they cross the Mexican border into the US. When in fact, their idol, Obama did the same thing for years during his time in power. What they do not want to admit to is the fact that today's illegal immigration picture is one that follows the Obama plan on dealing with the influx of illegals to a carbon copy. President Trump, on the other hand, is following along with it by detaining illegal immigrants at the border and separating children from their apparent families. Since no one can know if the children really belong to the illegals who say they are their parents, they are separated until that can be verified, along with other background findings. The bottom line is, both the Left and the Trump Administration seem to be following along with a plan of action going back to Jade Helm which paved the way for the housing needed for such a huge influx of illegal immigrants and refugees. All of which seems to be a planned event. In any case, neither side in DC is really interested in solving the illegal immigration problem or cares about the children involved. If they were, there would be no detention and separation after illegally coming into the US, only an immediate deportation by US Border Patrol on the spot.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

            "question": "Which of the following tactics is used in the following text?\n\nArticle: The Remnant Newspaper The unmasking of McCarrick exposed the pervasive prelate coverup of homosexual sexual predation in the American Catholic Church. These swarmy power brokers have colluded far too long at the tragic expense of innocent boys and seminarians. For 60 years, Ted McCarrick roamed the halls of seminaries, harassing, raping, and assaulting young males around the world. His brother bishops all knew and they all stayed silent. How fortuitous and revelatory that McCarrick, the Molester would divulge his personal role in the pre-Conclave lobbying effort to elect Jorge Bergoglio as Pope. The notorious lavender mafia anxiously sought a simpatico Pope to advance its reformist homosexual agenda. Bergoglio was their man. The now well known McCarrick Villanova Speech on October 13, 2013 where he relayed the story about a prominent Italian man who met with McCarrick to ask him to lobby for the election of Bergoglio to the papacy. In light of the McCarrick scandal, the conversation takes on new meaning... McCarrick described the conversation with the Influential Roman: \u201cBefore we went into the General Congregation, a very interesting and influential Italian gentleman came to see me at the Seminary (where else?) where I was staying. We sat down and he\u2019s a very brilliant man, very influential in Rome and said he had a favor to ask of me back home in the U.S., but then he said:\u201d Influential Roman: What about Bergoglio? Molester McCarrick: I was surprised and said, What about Bergoglio? Influential Roman: Does he have a chance? Molester McCarrick: I don\u2019t think so. No one has mentioned his name. He isn\u2019t on anyone\u2019s mind. Influential Roman: He could do it you know. Molester McCarrick: What could he do? Influential Roman: He could reform the Church. If you gave him 5 years, he could get us back on target. He\u2019s 76. If he had 5 years\u2014the Lord working through him, he could make the Church over again. Molester McCarrick: That\u2019s interesting. Influential Roman: I know you are his friend. Molester McCarrick: I hope I am. Influential Roman: Talk him up. Molester McCarrick'll vouch for ya, Francis! #bromance And talk him up, McCarrick the Molester did! Oh, the irony! That the most prolific serial predator Cardinal would divulge the pre-Conclave Bergoglio plot to \u201creform the Church.\u201d Now we know what \u201creform the Church\u201d looks like in the Bergoglian papacy. Yes, the clever and tyrannical Bergoglio, through his manipulation of synods, footnotes, exhortations, personal phone calls, airplane pressers, and correspondence has nearly completed his task of modernizing the Roman Catholic Church in the past 5 years. The rallying cry for his homosexual modern agenda was sounded in his July 29, 2013 airplane presser. Who am I to judge set the tone for merciful embrace of homosexual priests. After 5 long years, his unrelenting mercy mantra seemingly extends only to homosexual clerics, not to the laity or clergy victims who protest the cover ups by prelates. Francis\u2019 wink and nod to the homosexual lifestyle landed him on the cover of the Advocate, the gay magazine, as its Man of the Year. He lapped up the accolades from the secular culture and main stream media. Yet, fame is and predation is unrelenting, even for Popes. In the words of Queen Elizabeth, this year has been annus horribilis for Francis. Excuse the gay slang pun but, the chickens have come home to roost. The cascading revelations of papal sex scandals are toppling the barque of Peter. Will Catholic laity pay attention and take action? The McCarrick scandal created an earthquake in the Catholic Church with aftershocks that will last for years. The timing is eerily propitious and providential based on the 5 year deadline. Will the laity step up and reclaim our hijacked Catholic Church? This critical time in the history of the Catholic Church demands that the laity step forward to protect the Church, its children and seminarians from predators. We must close ranks before another precious child is exploited, a holy seminarian is violated, or another homosexual orgy is covered up at the Vatican. The first order of business is to scuttle the upcoming October Synod on Young People, the Faith, and Vocational Discernment. Remember that influential Roman gentleman friend of McCarrick who said that Bergoglio could reform the Church in 5 years? Bergoglio\u2019s upcoming Synod on Young People will serve as the culminating vehicle for the 5 year modernist reform of the St. Gallen Mafia. This Synod is designed to exploit the youth, like they\u2019ve been doing for the last 60 years. If it weren\u2019t so infuriating, it would be laughable that following the McCarrick scandal of sexual predation of young males and seminarians, by a Cardinal, and covered up by Bishops, the Catholic Church would host a Synod of Bishops on the topic of young people and vocations! Furthermore, this nightmare of a \u201csinod\" is inviting youth from ages 16-29 to mingle with the Bishops to discuss the Church, faith and vocations. Are you thoroughly disgusted by this farce? The Bishops have proven that they cannot be trusted to protect young people and seminarians from predators. The ever growing global list of Bishops and Cardinals that have preyed on /and or covered up the sexual abuse of minors and seminarians over the last 60 years continues to enrage the laity. We are no longer Shocked, just fed up. Let\u2019s start with the Cardinal who will lead the upcoming Synod, none other than Cardinal Kevin Farrell, Prefect of the Dicastery for Laity, Family and Life. As the DC roommate and protege of Ted McCarrick, Farrell so respected McCarrick, the Molester, that he fashioned his Coat of Arms as a tribute to Uncle Ted. Farrell\u2019s pathetic and laughable defense \u201cI never knew anything about McCarrick\u201d video highlights the continuing conspiracy of denial by the U.S. Catholic hierarchy. Undoubtedly, Farrell as the head of this Synod chose his dear friend gay friendly, Fr. James Martin, S.J. to keynote the Synod. Farrell\u2019s\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

The remarks, made in a February 6 talk in Slovakia, indirectly respond to new initiatives coming from Germany, especially from Cardinal Reinhard Marx and Bishop Franz-Josef Bode. Cardinal M\u00fcller, former Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, spoke at a conference on John Paul II's encyclical Veritatis Splendor at the Comenius University in Bratislava, organized by the Slovakian Bishops' Conference. In remarks after his address, reported by the German Catholic newspaper Die Tagespost, the cardinal made it clear what he thinks about the recently presented German idea of blessing homosexual unions, even if only in individual cases: \u201cIf a priest blesses a homosexual couple, then this is an atrocity at a holy site, namely, to approve of something that God does not approve of.\u201d According to the Tagespost report, Cardinal M\u00fcller said in his address that he regrets the separation of the Church's doctrinal and moral teaching and called Christianity a \u201ctheocentric humanism.\u201d He said the \u201csubmissive change of the Church into a NGO for the embetterment of the this-worldly life conditions\u201d is a \u201csuicidal modernization\u201d that denies mankind the Truth of God. In this context, the German cardinal also criticized Martin Luther's own denial of man's free will and his teaching about the total depravity of man that separates morality from the relationship with God. Morality, M\u00fcller explained, is rooted in Grace; that is why any teaching about \u201crules and exceptions\u201d ignores the character of the ethics of the Covenant and of Grace. In the discussion following his talk, Cardinal M\u00fcller also responded to questions concerning Pope Francis' post-synodal exhortation, Amoris Laetitia. The cardinal said that he is \u201cnot happy\u201d about the fact that there are different interpretations of this papal text by some bishops' conferences. \u201cIn dogmatic questions, there cannot be a plurality,\u201d he added. There is only one Magisterium, he said, and bishops' conferences can only decide about pastoral questions. Contradictory conceptions concerning the Sacraments, said the cardinal, lead into chaotic conditions. Thus, explained the cardinal, the Sacraments have to be celebrated the way Christ Himself willed it when he instituted them. The controversial eighth chapter of Amoris Laetitia has to be understood \u201cin an orthodox way,\u201d namely that \u201che who lives in the state of mortal sin cannot receive Holy Communion.\u201d It is, in M\u00fcller's eyes, the pope's duty \u201cto unite the Church, that is what the pope is there for.\u201d This is what he, M\u00fcller, himself told the pope: when the bishops' conferences present different interpretations of Amoris Laetitia, the Church enters \u201cinto a situation like the one before the Reformation.\u201d Archbishop Stanislav Zvolensy, President of the Slovakian Bishops' Conference and archbishop of Bratislava, told Die Tagespost that Veritatis Splendor is not only still valid, but shows timeless truths. Promulgated 25 years ago, the encyclical rejects authoritatively the theory of situation ethics, a theory that seems to be getting again much attention in our time, for example by theologians such as Professor Maurizio Chiodi. Professor Livio Melina, the former President of the Pontifical John Paul II Institute for Studies on Marriage and the Family, was another speaker at the February 6 conference. He stressed that Amoris Laetitia has to be \u201cread in the context of the magisterial instructions of the encyclical Veritatis Splendor, which recalls the connection between conscience and truth, as well as the necessity of a well-formed conscience.\u201d In returning to that encyclical, explained the Italian professor and theologian, Amoris Laetitia could be given a hermeneutic in light of a \u201ccontinuity with the Magisterium of the Church.\u201d He also said: \u201cThe Commandments are an expression of the Love of God for us. If we fulfill them, we are united with God.\u201d\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

They have betrayed the British people.\" \u201cNow, \u2018Islam\u2019 means \u2018Submission\u2019. You either submit, or you resist. Are you going to submit?\u201d he asked the crowds. \u201cAre you going to resist?\u201d The crowd shouted back their support of resisting and not submitting to the Islamization of their culture. Sharia Watch founder Anne Marie Waters also spoke at the rally. \u201cOur leaders, our media, our police, all prioritize Islam in their decision-making,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy is it so easy for our state to jail Tommy Robinson, when it is so difficult to jail a group of men found with an underage girl in a bedroom? Why is it so much easier to jail Tommy Robinson? \u201cWhy is it so easy to jail a man for leaving bacon at a mosque, but so difficult to jail jihadis who preach murder and death to the British people?\" she continued in a line of questioning. \u201cWhy is it so easy for judges to make rulings that allow known terrorists and jihadists to stay in our country? Why is the British government allowing ISIS fighters to return from Syria and threaten our safety? \u201cWhy do we talk and investigate and get angry about an accidental fire in Grenfell, but are expected to immediately forget \u2014 or \u2018not look back in anger\u2019 \u2014 about the deliberate, ideology-driven murder of British children?\" Waters went on. \u201cAnd why are Muslims allowed to cover their faces with a black sack while the rest of us are subject to strict security? Why are children being mutilated and forcefully raped while the law looks the other way? Forcefully married, child married, while the law looks the other way? Why? Why are animals slaughtered in agony and terror and Halal imposed on all of us in a country that has legislated against unstunned slaughter? Why?\" \u201cWhy is it so easy, Theresa May, to jail Tommy Robinson, but so difficult to do anything at all about the monstrous crimes committed in the name of Islam all over this country every day? Why?\u201d Waters asked. Well, the questions are obviously rhetorical. We know why. The UK is frightened of the Islamists, and by being frightened into submission, they are being complicit in the crimes of the devout Muslims there. My speech at the #FreeTommy protest yesterday. We need answers to our questions, and we need an MP in Parliament who will ask them. https://t.co/Rxx13odSC8 \u2014 Anne Marie Waters (@AMDWaters) June 10, 2018 Kassam also spoke at the event, reminding supporters of what was happening all across Europe due the mass influx of Muslim migrants.

Kristian Saucier, who served a year in federal prison for taking photos of classified sections of the submarine on which he worked, says he was subject to unequal protection of the law. Saucier said that he realizes he had erred in taking the photos, which he said he wanted to show only to his family to show them where he worked. He has also lashed out at Obama officials, saying that his prosecution was politically motivated, prompted by sensitivity about classified information amid the scandal involving Clinton\u2019s emails. According to Fox News, Saucier argues that the same officials who sought out punishment to Saucier for his actions chose to be lenient with Hillary Clinton in her use of a private email server and mishandling of classified information. Saucier\u2019s lawyer, Ronald Daigle, told Fox News on Monday that the lawsuit, which he expects to file soon in Manhattan, will name the U.S. Department of Justice, former FBI Director James Comey and former President Barack Obama as defendants, among others. Saucier, who lives in Vermont, pleaded guilty in 2016 to taking photos inside the USS Alexandria while it was stationed in Groton, Connecticut, in 2009. He said he only wanted service mementos, but federal prosecutors argued he was a disgruntled sailor who had put national security at risk by taking photos showing the submarine\u2019s propulsion system and reactor compartment and then obstructed justice by destroying a laptop and camera. \u2013Fox News \u201cThey interpreted the law in my case to say it was criminal,\u201d Saucier told Fox News, referring to prosecuting authorities in his case, \u201cbut they didn\u2019t prosecute Hillary Clinton. Hillary is still walking free. Two guys on my ship did the same thing and weren\u2019t treated as criminals. We want them to correct the wrong.\u201d Daigle said that a notice about the pending lawsuit was sent to the Department of Justice and others included in it in December. There is usually a six-month period that must elapse before the lawsuit actually is actually filed. \u201cMy case was usually something handled by military courts,\u201d he said. \u201cThey used me as an example because of [the backlash over] Hillary Clinton,\u201d he continued, alleging his life was ruined for political reasons. \u201cWith a pardon, there\u2019s no magic wand that gets waved and makes everything right,\u201d Saucier said, \u201cBut I try to stay positive and look forward.\u201d Saucier has had cars repossessed and is in debt due to the loss of income after having a felony on his record. The government actively destroyed his life an made it all but impossible for his family to get back on track. But Hillary Clinton is running around free, to this day. And that is what Saucier is so burnt about, with good reason.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

With the ease of spreading the plague, the likelihood that this disease will move to other more densely populated regions of the planet has become a huge concern for many. So far, the plague has claimed 57 lives and infected more than 680 others. These figures are from October 12, however, and the disease is spreading rapidly. An estimated 329 of these cases and 25 of the deaths were in the capital city of Antananarivo. Of the 684 cases reported as of October 12, 474 were the pneumonic plague, 156 bubonic and 1 septicemic plague. A further 54 were unspecified, according to the World Health Organization. Of Madagascar\u2019s 114 districts, 35 have reported cases of plague, including at least 10 cities. Plague is caused by infection with the bacterium Yersinia pestis and is typically spread through the bite of infected fleas, frequently carried by rats. The bacteria will eventually end up causing the often fatal plague. Symptoms can include painful, swollen lymph nodes, called buboes, as well as fever, chills, and coughing. Pneumonic plague is more virulent or damaging and is an advanced form of the disease characterized by a severe lung infection. The infection can be transmitted from person to person via airborne droplets from coughing or sneezing. The incubation period is extremely short too, and an infected person may die within 12 to 24 hours of contracting the bacteria making cures in underdeveloped regions of the globe difficult at best. According to CNN, the cases were reported by both the World Health Organization (WHO) and the National Bureau for Risk and Disaster Management (BNGRC) in Madagascar. They include probable and suspected cases as well those that have been confirmed by laboratory tests. And while the country experiences regular outbreaks, with an estimated 400 cases of plague each year, this time things are very different, experts warn. This year, health officials report the infections started much earlier than usual, and they\u2019re occurring in new areas, including urban settings. They\u2019ve also seen an unexpected number of cases of pneumonic plague, which transmits more easily from person to person. Historically dubbed the \u201cblack death\u201d the bubonic plague has been responsible for several worldwide pandemics in the past. Early detection of the plague is key since both forms of it can be cured with antibiotics. But, occasionally there can be cases of septicemic plague, where the infection has spread to a person\u2019s bloodstream and can cause bleeding and necrosis of tissue, turning it black. Internationally, this outbreak is also being taken seriously. WHO delivered more than 1.2 million doses of antibiotics and released $1.5 million in emergency funds earlier this month. The Red Cross has released more than $1 million to deploy a treatment center and has mobilized more than 1,000 volunteers and is upgrading their skills on community surveillance, finding and monitoring people who have been in contact with infected patients and insightful messaging to stop the spread of this disease.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

As the Senate has requested, this update must be limited in scope and completed in less than one week,\u201d the president said in a statement. The scope and one-week limitations were what Senator Jeff Flake proposed just prior to the vote that passed the Kavanaugh nomination out of committee and to the Senate for a vote on his confirmation. take our poll - story continues below Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?

The statement came just a day after Senate Democrats continued their smear of Kavanaugh by declaring they believed Dr. Christine Ford's allegations against him while at the same time obviously not believing his denial of the allegations. On top of that, there has been zero evidence submitted to the committee that Ford's allegations are true. In fact, everything submitted has refuted her claims, from sworn statements by those she claims were there to Kavanaugh's calendar to character statements by dozens of women who have known him since high school to those he has worked with in DC. All of the people named by Ford have already submitted statements that they have no memory of the event ever occurring, including a female friend of hers at the time. Two of those named have stated that they will cooperate with the FBI. \u201cI will cooperate with any law enforcement agency that is assigned to confidentially investigate these allegations,\u201d Kavanaugh friend Mark Judge said. \u201cMy client, Patrick J. Smyth, is happy to cooperate fully with this FBI investigation,\u201d said attorney Eric B. Bruce. Kavanaugh also said he would be cooperating as he has in the past. \u201cThroughout this process, I\u2019ve been interviewed by the FBI, I\u2019ve done a number of \u2018background\u2019 calls directly with the Senate, and yesterday, I answered questions under oath about every topic the Senators and their counsel asked me,\" Kavanaugh said in a statement that was released by the White House. \"I\u2019ve done everything they have requested and will continue to cooperate.\" Well, Senator Flake has given the Democrats what they wanted and you can bet that they are still going to vote pretty much on party lines concerning Kavanaugh. Now, President Trump has gone along with it. My guess is that one of two things will occur with the FBI investigation: (1) Absolutely nothing will be found, and this will have been a huge waste of time or (2) look for this thing to expand and the need will arise to make this more of a circus than it already is, which will dwarf anything Clarence Thomas had to face from the slanderous accusations of Anita Hill. Remember, whether you like Judge Kavanaugh or not, this has been nothing but a political hit.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

President Donald Trump took to Twitter Wednesday to call on his Attorney General Jeff Sessions to shut down special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Sessions is a weak sister. He has to go. This leftwing witch hunt has been ongoing since day one of Trump\u2019s presidency in order to impair and impede his ability to get the job done. It\u2019s a stealth coup. Sessions is a weak sister. He has to go.

Trump\u2019s mention of 17 prosecution lawyers is a reference to what he claims is an abundance of Democrats on Mueller\u2019s staff. The special counsel himself is a Republican. take our poll - story continues below Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court? Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?

Sessions, who was a Trump campaign adviser and the first sitting senator to endorse his candidacy, recused himself from the Russia probe in March 2016 because he expected the campaign to be one focus of the investigation. That gave the reins to his deputy Rod Rosenstein, who later appointed Mueller. Trump has publicly criticized Sessions before, tweeting in June that the Mueller \u2018witch hunt\u2019 was only proceeding \u2018because Jeff Sessions didn\u2019t tell me he was going to recuse himself.\u2019 \u2018I would have quickly picked someone else. So much time and money wasted, so many lives ruined \u2026 and Sessions knew better than most that there was No Collusion\u2019 with the Kremlin,\u2019 he added. The new tensions between the president and the nation\u2019s top law enforcer come as Mueller\u2019s team is prosecuting former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort on money laundering, tax evasion and bank fraud charges. The allegations in that trial, which began Tuesday, are related to Manafort\u2019s financial dealings long before he was involved in the 2016 election cycle. But firing Mueller would likely send a signal to Democrats that the White House is worried about potential blowback from a Manafort conviction just three months before the congressional midterm elections. Still, Trump went all-in with a new intensity on Wednesday, opening up on Mueller and his team with both barrels of his massive Twitter following. \u2018Russian Collusion with the Trump Campaign, one of the most successful in history, is a TOTAL HOAX,\u2019 he wrote. \u2018The Democrats paid for the phony and discredited Dossier which was, along with Comey, McCabe, Strzok and his lover, the lovely Lisa Page, used to begin the Witch Hunt.

Keith Ellison because the lawmaker\u2019s ex-girlfriend refused to provide video of the incident - but the findings are still being turned over to law enforcement. The Associated Press on Monday reported that it obtained a draft of a report written by Susan Ellingstad, a lawyer hired by Minnesota's Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party to investigate the claim against Ellison. \"The investigation report, which was released today without our knowledge by someone outside of our organization, was unable to substantiate the claim of physical abuse made by Ms. Monahan,\u201d DFL Chairman Ken Martin said in a statement. Martin said they planned to turn over the report to local law enforcement. \u201cFor the purpose of objectivity and getting all of the facts regarding these allegations, we have decided to forward the information in the investigation to local authorities in order to let them review the contents and determine whether further investigation is warranted,\u201d Martin said. The Democratic congressman, who serves as deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee, has denied the allegations. In a statement, Ellison thanked Ellingstad for conducting a \"thorough, independent, and fair review.\" \"I believe women who come forward must be heard, and to have their allegations fully investigated,\" Ellison said. \"This is why I have complied with this investigation fully, and will do so with any other inquiries. ... At this time, I will be focusing on the issues of this important election.\" Ellison\u2019s ex-girlfriend, Karen Monahan, alleged in August that Ellison dragged her off a bed by her feet while screaming obscenities at her in 2016. Monahan said she had video footage of the incident and levied the allegation just days ahead of a crowded Democratic primary for Minnesota attorney general that Ellison went on to win. The state's Democratic party launched an investigation into the claim, retaining a local attorney with links to the state party to determine whether the alleged incident took place. Democratic party chairman Ken Martin said last week he expected the investigation to conclude soon. A draft report obtained by the AP noted Monahan's shifting rationale for refusing to produce the video footage, including that it was lost, was on a USB drive in storage and would be too embarrassing and traumatic to release it. The Ellison accusations have put Democrats in an uncomfortable position, as they speak out on sexual misconduct claims against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. Kavanaugh denies the accusations. Monahan slammed the Democratic Party for its response to her allegations when compared to its treatment of Christine Blasey Ford. Ford has accused Kavanaugh of attempting to force himself onto her during a high school party nearly four decades ago. Many prominent Democrats have supported Ford\u2019s allegations. \u201cNo, they don't,\u201d Monahan tweeted in response to a question of whether the party believes women\u2019s stories. \u201cI've been smeared, threatened, isolated from my own party. I provided medical records from 2017, stating on two different Dr. Visits, I told them about the abuse and who did it. My therapist released records stating I have been dealing and healing from the abuse.\u201d She added: \u201cFour people, including my supervisor at the time, stated that I came to them after and shared the exact story I shared publicly, I shared multiple text between me and Keith, where I discuss the abuse with him and much more. As I said before, I knew I wouldn't be believed.\u201d Many other Democrats and progressives \u2013 who largely stayed silent after the accusations against Ellison emerged \u2013 came out in support of Ford, including Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Tom Perez, chairman of the DNC, who urged to investigate the claims and Kavanaugh. Monahan went to reiterate that her story has nothing to do with politics. \u201cI have nothing to prove to anyone, I simply shared my story. People can believe it or not. I don\u2019t need anyone to affirm my humanity, I affirmed it,\u201d she wrote in another tweet. \u201cThe fact that both parties only care if it scores political points is hypocritical,\u201d she added. \u201cDo you think a person who has dealt with any form of abuse by politicians is thinking about politics?

Newest reports from the island territory now show that the number of residents without clean drinking water and electricity continues to rise, despite humanitarian efforts. Puerto Rico\u2019s government has reported that roughly 10 percent of the islands 3.4 million United States citizens are without electricity Tuesday morning, an increase of about six percent from Monday.

This news comes just one day after Puerto Rico\u2019s Governor Ricardo Rossello asked the federal government for an additional $4.6 billion in funding beyond the Trump administration\u2019s request last week for $29 billion from Congress for relief efforts. \u201cPuerto Rico has experienced a natural disaster of a magnitude not seen in over a century, and we are doing everything possible to address the needs of the American citizens of Puerto Rico during this time of crisis,\u201d Rossell\u00f3 wrote. \u201cHowever, the unprecedented level of destruction, coupled with the almost complete shut-down of business in Puerto Rico, have made it impossible for us to meet the considerable human needs without the measures proposed above,\u201d he added. The White House also announced Monday that it would allow a 10-day waiver temporarily blocking the Jones Act to expire. This is devastating news for those living in Puerto Rico, as foreign ships can no longer bring aid to the hurricane-ravaged island from U.S. ports. Officials still expect it to be six more months before electricity can be fully restored to Puerto Rico. As the days have become weeks, the weeks will become months, and survival will get more difficult. Many are now fleeing to the mainland United States just so that they can survive. The economy in Puerto Rico is at a standstill, and without clean drinking water, many are finding life too difficult should they remain on the island and isolated.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

As state officials prepare to certify the vote, Abrams acknowledged the law \u201callows no further viable remedy\u201d to extend her quest to be the nation\u2019s first black female governor. But she laced her speech with biting criticism of Kemp, who she accused of leveraging his role as the state\u2019s top elections official to suppress voters. \u201cI will not concede,\u201d she added, \u201cbecause the erosion of our democracy is not right.\u201d You mean like having a sister waiting in the wings of any campaign lawsuits, Ms. Abrams? What about invalid provisional ballots getting mixed in with valid ones? Maybe a little electronic voter manipulation, Ms. Abrams? How about non-citizens and illegal aliens voting, Ms. Abrams? Are these evidence of the erosion of the democratic process? Sure they are and they appear to all be coming from the party that Stacey Abrams represents, but she's not going to talk about that.

[Editors' note: To best understand why Facebook would ban Jamie Glazov on 9/11 for his article on how to best prevent more 9/11s, pre-order Jamie's new book, Jihadist Psychopath: How He Is Charming, Seducing, and Devouring Us: HERE. The book illustrates how the Jihadist Psychopath has successfully built his totalitarian plantation -- on which many in the West are now enslaved and dutifully following his orders. Jamie outlines the frameworks of this tyrannical plantation and how those who are trapped on it, and yearn for freedom, can best escape.] Reprinted from WND.com. Somewhere in the \u201ccommunity standards\u201d that Facebook demands everyone follow is a real doozy. The social-media company has told author and commentator Jamie Glazov that their standards forbid his article about how to prevent jihadi attacks on Americans. It\u2019s all about Glazov\u2019s new book, \u201cJihadist Psychopath: How He Is Charming, Seducing, and Devouring Us.\u201d At FrontPage Magazine, where he is editor, he had posted \u201c9 Steps to Successfully Counter Jihad,\u201d which included recommendations such as \u201cLabel the enemy and make a threat assessment\u201d and \u201cStop \u2018partnering\u2019 with Muslim Brotherhood front groups.\u201d That apparently was too much for Facebook, which declared \u201conly you can see this post\u201d because it \u201cgoes against our Community Standards.\u201d He was suspended from Facebook for 30 days on Sept. 11, the anniversary of the Islamic jihadist attack on America that killed nearly 3,000. Glazov told Breitbart, \u201cThis is really getting surreal in the creepiest and most harrowing Stalinist sense.\u201d FrontPage Magazine reported: Facebook\u2019s Unholy Alliance masters are, without doubt, accelerating their totalitarian suffocation of free thought and expression. It is no surprise, therefore, that Frontpage\u2019s editor, and host of \u2018The Glazov Gang,\u2019 was suspended from Facebook for 30 days yesterday, on September 11, after posting his article, \u20189 Steps to Successfully Counter Jihad.\u2019 Glazov believed that the article was more relevant and urgent than ever due to the skyrocketing jihadist stabbings in Europe \u2014 and to the 17th anniversary of 9/11 that was approaching the next day. The report said it appears \u201cthat daring to give suggestions on how our civilization can stop jihadist attacks and another 9/11 is against Facebook\u2019s \u2018community standards.'\u201d \u201cGlazov\u2019s advice also involves the promotion of supporting moderate Muslims \u2013 a move that is, clearly, horrifying to Facebook\u2019s masters and therefore also violates their \u2018community standards,'\u201d the report said. No doubt, Glazov\u2019s consistent campaigning on behalf of Muslim women and girls in his efforts to protect them from FGM, honor killings and other Shariah barbarities, has gained him the anger and hatred of Facebook\u2019s guardians \u2014 who are clearly on the side of the Shariah enforcers and oppressors of Muslim women and girls. The report recalls that Facebook censored Glazov in April for posting screenshots of a Muslim\u2019s threat to him. Twitter also lashed out at him for quoting directly from Islamic religious texts, citing its anti-\u201chate\u201d policies. It is \u2018hateful conduct,\u2019 apparently, to reference what Islamic texts themselves say. Indeed, Frontpage\u2019s editor had simply referred to Sahih Bukhari\u2019s texts discussing Mohammed\u2019s marriage to Aisha when she was six years old (7.62.88) and to Quranic Suras that mandate the Hijab for women (24:31; 33:59) and sanction sexual slavery (4:3; 33:50). Facebook also refused to respond to Glazov\u2019s inquiry about \u201cwhat it is specifically that violates Facebook\u2019s \u2018community standards\u2019 when a person gives advice on how to best defend American lives from jihad.\u201d Glazov has written about the subject in previous books, including \u201cHigh Noon for America: The Coming Showdown\u201d and \u201cUnited in Hate.\u201d In his \u201c9 Steps\u201d article, he points out that the Obama administration was \u201ccooperating with, and listening to, Muslim Brotherhood front groups such as CAIR and ISNA.\u201d The government needs, he said, to \u201cimplement a concrete \u2018countering-jihad\u2019 strategy.\u201d And he said it needs to affirm \u201cShariah\u2019s assault on the U.S. Constitution as seditious.\u201d A last key point, the said, is to ridicule the enemy. Ridicule is a vicious and potent weapon. There is a baffling and shameful silence in our culture\u2019s sphere of comedy, especially in Hollywood and our media, with regard to the myriad ingredients of Shariah and jihad that merit at least a million hilarious satirical sketches. Bill Maher, for whatever unappealing drawbacks he has in conservatives\u2019 eyes, has set a bold standard in this respect in his Burka Fashion Show skit. American comedians need to start writing scripts that follow in Maher\u2019s footsteps and Americans need to encourage and equip them to do so \u2013 and to also vigorously defend them from the attacks and slanders they will inevitably receive from totalitarian leftist and Islamic forces.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

In Oct. 1945 he became head of the Church in Hungary and spoke out just as strongly against Communist oppression. He wound up back in prison for eight more years, including long periods of solitary confinement and endured other forms of torture. In 1949 he was sentenced to life in a show trial that generated worldwide condemnation. Two weeks after the trial began in early 1949, Pope Pius XII (having failed to speak out forcefully against the Third Reich) did summon the courage to condemn what was happening to Mindszenty. Pius excommunicated everyone involved in the Mindszenty trial. Then, addressing a huge crowd on St. Peter\u2019s Square, he asked, \u201cDo you want a Church that remains silent when she should speak \u2026 a Church that does not condemn the suppression of conscience and does not stand up for the just liberty of the people \u2026 a Church that locks herself up within the four walls of her temple in unseemly sycophancy \u2026?\u201d When the Hungarian revolution broke out in 1956, Mindszenty was freed, but only for four days. When Soviet tanks rolled back into Budapest, he fled to the U.S. embassy and was given immediate asylum by President Eisenhower. Speaking Freely: Ray M... Buy New $1.99 (as of 09:20 EDT - Details) There the Cardinal stayed cooped up for the next 15 years. Mindszenty\u2019s mother was permitted to visit him four times a year, and the communist authorities stationed secret police outside the embassy ready to arrest him should he try to leave. Sound familiar? Where is the voice of conscience to condemn what is happening to Julian Assange, whose only \u201ccrime\u201d is publishing documents exposing the criminal activities and corruption of governments and other Establishment elites? Decades ago, the U.S. and \u201ccivilized world\u201d had nothing but high praise for the courageous Mindszenty. He became a candidate for sainthood. And Assange? He has been confined in the Ecuadorian embassy in London for six years \u2014from June 19, 2012\u2014the victim of a scurrilous slander campaign and British threats to arrest him, should he ever step outside. The U.S. government has been putting extraordinary pressure on Ecuador to end his asylum and top U.S. officials have made it clear that, as soon as they get their hands on him, they will manufacture a reason to put him on trial and put him in prison. All for spreading unwelcome truth around. A Suppression of Conscience One might ask, is \u201cunseemly sycophancy\u201d at work among the media? The silence of what used to be the noble profession of journalism is deafening.

It is as if a one-way moral screen has been pushed back to expose the imperialism of liberal democracies: the commitment to endless warfare \u2026 When Harold Pinter accepted the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2005, he referred to \u2018a vast tapestry of lies up on which we feed.\u2019 He asked why \u2018the systematic brutality, the widespread atrocities, the ruthless suppression of independent thought\u2019 of the Soviet Union were well known in the West while America\u2019s imperial crimes \u201cnever happened \u2026 even while [they] were happening, they never happened.\u2019\u201d WikiLeaks and 9/11: What if? In an op-ed published several years ago by The Los Angeles Times, two members of Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity, Coleen Rowley and Bogdan Dzakovic, pointed out that \u2014 If WikiLeaks had been up and running before 9/11 \u2014 frustrated FBI investigators might have chosen to leak information that their superiors bottled up, perhaps averting the terrorism attacks. \u201cThere were a lot of us in the run-up to Sept. 11 who had seen warning signs that something devastating might be in the planning stages. But we worked for ossified bureaucracies incapable of acting quickly and decisively. Lately, the two of us have been wondering how things might have been different if there had been a quick, confidential way to get information out.\u201d The WikiLeaks Files: T...

As the outbreak worsens, some doctors are even warning that \u201cno one is safe\u201d from the disease. The outbreak of the black plague in Madagascar has so far killed 97 people, and doctors are warning that it will be continuing to spread and worsen, meaning no one is safe. Health officials say the disease, which contributed to the deaths of more than 50 million people in Europe during the Middle Ages, has spread from rural areas to the more urban areas not usually affected. Hundreds of cases are reported on the tropical island every year, but experts are warning the epidemic is \u201cmuch more dangerous\u201d than in previous years. Officials have reported infections in 17 of the island nation\u2019s 22 regions since the outbreak started in August. And the number of cases is growing by the day, said Elhadj As Sy, the secretary general of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) as the nation put all hospitals on high alert. The hospitals have also begun implementing preventative measures with attempts to stall the spread of the bacterial infection. The IFRC said it\u2019s introducing the same \u201csafe and dignified\u201d burial methods used in West Africa during the 2014 Ebola epidemic. This helps cut the chain of transmission by preventing further infections through direct contact with infected corpses. Last week, less than 60 people had died and around 600 had been infected. Now, there are 911 confirmed cases in addition to the almost 100 deaths. While cases of bubonic plague occur in Madagascar nearly every year, the much more dangerous and deadly pneumonic plague has never been so prevalent. It arrived earlier than expected this year, and has become much more contagious with it being transmitted from person to person through the air. Pneumonic plague is the most life-threatening form of the infection caused by the manifestation of a Yersinia pestis bacterial infection. Although the black plague can be treated effectively with antibiotics, the incubation time of this bacteria is incredibly short. Death often occurs within 12-24 hours of becoming infected. The bubonic strain of the disease is spread through the bites of infected fleas, whereas the more contagious and deadly pneumonic type is spread through the coughing or sneezing of an infected person. Elhadj As Sy said that overcoming the epidemic would require long-term help, not \u201cjust intervening at the peak and then forgetting about it\u201d. Dr. Manitra Rakotoarivony, Madagascar\u2019s director of health promotion, said: \u201cNormally, people who catch the plague live in poor areas, but people in every place in society are catching the disease.\u201d Jimmy Whitworth, professor of International Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told The Sun: \u201cIt has been a long time since we have seen the plague in an urban environment. Although health officials have said that internationally, the threat is still fairly low, they\u2019ve also said no one in Madagascar is safe, including travelers, spiking concerns over a possible global pandemic.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

Now, why is that? \u201cChristian Parent Furious After School Instructs Children To Write Out Their Submission To Allah,\u201d by Joshua Gill, Daily Caller News Foundation, May 17, 2018 (thanks to the Geller Report): A West Virginia school has come under fire for instructing junior high students to write the Islamic profession of faith ostensibly to practice calligraphy. Rich Penkoski, a Christian parent and founder of online ministry Warriors for Christ, raised alarms over a packet on Islam his daughter\u2019s seventh grade social studies teacher issued to students, according to Christian Post. The packet, edited from the full version of a world religions workbook, instructed students to practice writing the Shahada, or Islamic profession of faith, in Arabic calligraphy \u2014 an assignment that, if left undone, would result in detention, according to Penkoski\u2019s daughter. The Shahada states: \u201cThere is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah.\u201d Penkoski called Mountain Ridge Middle School Principal Ron Branch and objected to the packet, saying it disturbed him and had misinformation about the history of calligraphy. \u201cI saw the assignment of writing the Shahada in Arabic. Their excuse was calligraphy,\u201d Penkoski told The Christian Post. \u201cI was like, \u2018Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!\u2019 First of all, calligraphy was invented in China 3,000 years prior to Muhammad. The fact that they were trying to get my daughter to write that disturbed me.\u201d \u201cI said, \u2018That is not happening. My daughter is not doing that.\u2019 My daughter told me that if she didn\u2019t do the assignment, then she was going to get a [detention] slip,\u201d Penkoski added\u2026. There were two different calligraphy assignments \u2014 one involving the Shahada and another instructing students to practice writing English letters in calligraphy, Branch told Christian Post. Hinson \u201ctold the students that they could do these activities if they wanted,\u201d Branch claimed. \u201cThe teacher has told her class several times that this is a study of world religions and that she is not trying to advocate for any religion over another. She has told her class that if they had questions about religious beliefs, that those conversations should take place with their parents,\u201d Branch added. Penkoski claimed the teacher sent students home with the same packet the day after he lodged a complaint \u2014 this time, with certain sections crossed out but still including the Shahada assignment. Penkoksi called the principal again and confronted Hinson over the phone. \u201cI said, \u2018This is not OK in asking my kid to write down the Shahada.\u2019 The teacher happened to walk-in and said she made it an option and that the kids didn\u2019t have to do it. My daughter conflicted that story and said, \u2018No, that is not what was said.\u2019 What was said was, \u2018Do the assignment; and if you want to learn more about the Quran, ask your parents,\u2019\u201d Penkoski told Christian Post. Each religion studied in the class, including Christianity and Judaism, received \u201cequitable treatment,\u201d Branch also told Christian Post. He said the class spent a week and a half on Christianity and Judaism \u2014 other religions took one week \u2014 and discussed each religion\u2019s beliefs, history and practices. During the section on Christianity, \u201cJesus was taught,\u201d Branch claimed. \u201cThe students read the chapter in our textbook that discusses Christianity\u2019s belief that Jesus is the Son of God, and salvation. They also discussed the Sermon on the Mount, the Last Supper and Jesus\u2019 Betrayal, the Trinity, and the Lord\u2019s Prayer, among other topics,\u201d Branch said. Penkoski and his daughter, Brielle, contested Branch\u2019s claims. The Lord\u2019s Prayer was not taught, and very little time was spent teaching about Jesus, they told Christian Post. \u201cWe did [the unit on Christianity] over a week and two days. We watched two different videos. We didn\u2019t finish them. They taught a little bit about Moses and the Ten Commandments, Peter and Paul,\u201d Brielle explained. \u201cWe learned about the Israelites and how they are being persecuted by the Romans. We were told about the Jews and told a little bit about Jesus.\u201d Penkoski also shared with Christian Post the packets on Christianity and Judaism passed out in class and allegedly modified from the original full version. While the packet on Islam contained verses from the Koran, the packets for those religions did not contain scripture and did not encourage students to write prayers or faith statements, he said. \u201cNotice no Bible verses, no reciting the Ten Commandments or the Lord\u2019s Prayer,\u201d he said. \u201c[There\u2019s] no practicing writing in Hebrew as compared to the Islamic packet,\u201d he added\u2026.

Pompeo expressed confidence Wednesday that the Saudi government could be trusted to investigate the disappearance and suspected murder of a U.S.-based Saudi journalist in a Saudi diplomatic facility in Turkey \u2014 despite the likelihood that senior Saudi officials were involved. Speaking in Ankara, Turkey, Pompeo offered that support hours after President Donald Trump had mounted an even stronger defense for the Saudi rulers, saying, \u201cHere we go again with you\u2019re guilty until proven innocent.\u201d Together they appeared to signal a shift in White House strategy \u2014 earlier this week Trump had warned Saudi rulers could face \u201csevere punishment\u201d \u2014 and suggested the administration has decided to help its most important ally in the Arab world defuse an international crisis over the fate of Jamal Khashoggi. The dissident journalist, who lived in Virginia, vanished Oct. 2 after he entered the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, Turkey. Neither Trump nor his top diplomat offered any new facts or insights in the case. But unless authorities recover his body or other conclusive evidence of his death, the mystery may remain unsolved. Pompeo wrapped up two days of emergency talks in the region \u2014 first with Saudi King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh, and then with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara \u2014 and headed back to Washington on Wednesday. Turkish officials have described \u2014 but have not released \u2014 what they say are audio and video recordings that show the 60-year-old contributor to the Washington Post opinion pages was interrogated, tortured and killed by Saudi intelligence officers inside the consulate. Turkish officials say Khashoggi\u2019s body was cut up with a bone saw, then taken out of the building. Turkish crime scene investigators and forensic specialists were allowed to search for evidence in the Saudi consulate and a nearby residence on Tuesday. Erdogan later complained that the interior walls had been repainted in recent days. On his flight from Riyadh to Ankara, Pompeo reiterated his confidence that the Saudi government would conduct a \u201cthorough, complete, and transparent investigation,\u201d adding that they will \u201cshow the entire world\u201d the results. He said Saudi leaders made a commitment \u201cto hold anyone connected to any wrongdoing that may be found accountable for that, whether they are a senior officer or official.\u201d He said they made \u201cno exceptions,\u201d including presumably members of the royal family. Asked if the Saudis had informed him whether Khashoggi was alive or dead, Pompeo said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about any of the facts. They didn\u2019t want to either, in that they want to have the opportunity to complete this investigation in a thorough way.\u201d Asked if he believed the Saudi rulers\u2019 repeated denial of complicity, Pompeo said he was reserving judgment. \u201cI think that\u2019s \u2014 I think that\u2019s \u2014 I think that\u2019s a reasonable thing to do, to give them that opportunity,\u201d Pompeo said, \u201c(and then) we\u2019ll all get to evaluate the work that they do.\u201d Pompeo refused to discuss possible consequences for those found responsible for Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance, reiterating at least three times the \u201cimportance of the investigation.\u201d Later Wednesday, Pompeo said during a refueling stopover in Brussels that Erdogan had informed him the Saudis were cooperating with the Turkish investigation \u201cafter a couple of delays.\u201d Turkish officials \u201cseemed pretty confident the Saudis will permit them to do things they need to do to complete\u201d the investigation, Pompeo told reporters traveling with him. In a sign that the administration is looking to help Saudi Arabia get out of its dilemma, Pompeo urged Americans to be mindful of the extensive energy, economic and security ties between Riyadh and Washington, including efforts against what he called the world\u2019s largest supporter of terrorism, Iran. \u201cThe Saudis have been great partners in working alongside us on these issues,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cWe need to make sure we are mindful of that as we approach decisions\u201d on whether to impose sanctions or take other punitive steps against Riyadh, as many in Congress and elsewhere have urged. Critics questioned whether the Saudi rulers, who preside over an authoritarian regime that allows little opposition, can be relied on to conduct a credible probe into Khashoggi\u2019s fate \u2014 especially without decisive pressure from their close ally, the Trump administration. Saudi leaders for two weeks denied knowing anything about the Khashoggi case. On Monday, they began floating a scenario \u2014 initially adopted by Trump \u2014 that blamed the murder inside the consulate on \u201crogue killers,\u201d and then suggested the writer was accidentally killed during an interrogation that went awry. Analysts familiar with the desert kingdom said it was likely Saudi leaders were hoping the scandal would blow over and that they could wait it out. \u201cWe received commitments that they would complete this (investigation), and I am counting on them to do that,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cThey gave me their word.\u201d \u2014 Tracy Wilkinson Los Angeles Times \u2014\u2014\u2014 \u00a92018 Los Angeles Times, Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

Candidate Donald Trump may have promised to extricate us from Middle East wars, once ISIS and al-Qaida were routed, yet events and people seem to be conspiring to keep us endlessly enmeshed. Friday night, a drone, apparently modeled on a U.S. drone that fell into Iran's hands, intruded briefly into Israeli airspace over the Golan Heights, and was shot down by an Apache helicopter. Israel seized upon this to send F-16s to strike the airfield whence the drone originated. Returning home, an F-16 was hit and crashed, unleashing the most devastating Israeli attack in decades on Syria. Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu says a dozen Syrian and Iranian bases and antiaircraft positions were struck. Monday's headline on The Wall Street Journal op-ed page blared: \"The Pentagon and State Department have already condemned Iran and thrown their support behind Israel. The question now is whether the Trump administration will go further. ... Secretary of State Rex Tillerson (has) affirmed that the U.S. seeks not only to ensure its allies' security but to deny Iran its 'dreams of a northern arch' from Tehran to Beirut. A good way to achieve both objectives would be back Israel's response to Iran's aggression--now and in the future.\" Op-ed writers Tony Badran and Jonathan Schanzer, both from the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, The FDD is an annex of the Israeli lobby and a charter member of the War Party. Chagai Tzuriel , who heads the Israeli Ministry of Intelligence, echoed the FDD: \"If you (Americans) are committed to countering Iran in the region, then you must do so in Syria--first.\" Our orders have been cut. Iran has dismissed as \"lies\" and \"ridiculous\" the charge that it sent the drone into Israeli airspace. If Tehran did, it would be an act of monumental stupidity. Not only did the drone bring devastating Israeli reprisals against Syria and embarrass Iran's ally Russia, it brought attacks on Russian-provided and possibly Russian-manned air defenses. Moreover, in recent months Iranian policy--suspending patrol boat harassment of U.S. warships--appears crafted to ease tensions and provide no new causes for Trump to abandon the nuclear deal Prime Minister Hassan Rouhani regards as his legacy. Indeed, why would Iran, which, with Assad, Russia and Hezbollah, is among the victors in Syria's six-year civil war, wish to reignite the bloodletting and bring Israeli and U.S. firepower in on the other side? In Syria's southeast, another incident a week ago may portend an indefinite U.S. stay in that broken and bleeding country. To recapture oil fields lost in the war, forces backed by Assad crossed the Euphrates into territory taken from ISIS by the U.S. and our Kurd allies. The U.S. response was a barrage of air and artillery strikes that killed 100 soldiers. What this signals is that, though ISIS has been all but evicted from Syria, the U.S. intends to retain that fourth of Syria as a bargaining chip in negotiations. In the northwest, Turkey has sent its Syrian allies to attack Afrin and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has threatened Manbij, 80 miles to the east, where U.S. troops commingle with the Kurd defenders and U.S. generals were visible last week. Midweek, Erdogan exploded: \"(The Americans) tell us, 'Don't come to Manbij.' We will come to Manbij to hand over these territories to their rightful owners.\" The U.S. and Turkey, allies for six decades, with the largest armies in NATO, may soon be staring down each other's gun barrels. Has President Trump thought through where we are going with this deepening commitment in Syria, where we have only 2,000 troops and no allies but the Kurds, while on the other side is the Syrian army, Hezbollah, Russia and Iran, and Shiite militias from Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan? Clearly, we have an obligation not to abandon the Kurds, who took most of the casualties in liberating eastern Syria from ISIS. And we have a strategic interest in not losing Turkey as an ally. But this calls for active diplomacy, not military action. And now that the rebels have been defeated and the civil war is almost over, what would be the cost and what would be the prospects of fighting a new and wider war? What would victory look like? Bibi and the FDD want to see U.S. power deployed alongside that of Israel, against Iran, Assad and Hezbollah. But while Israel's interests are clear, what would be the U.S. vital interest? What outcome would justify another U.S. war in a region where all the previous wars in this century have left us bleeding, bankrupt, divided and disillusioned? When he was running , Donald Trump seemed to understand this. COPYRIGHT 2018 CREATORS.COM Patrick J. Buchanan needs no introduction to VDARE.COM readers; his books and are available from Amazon.com.

            "question": "Which of the following tactics is used in the following text?\n\nArticle: Puerto Rico says to receive $16 bln in federal disaster aid By Nick Brown Feb 9 (Reuters) - Puerto Rico said on Friday it will receive $16 billion in federal aid under a disaster recovery package signed on Friday by U.S. President Donald Trump. That money includes nearly $7 billion announced on Wednesday and will help the bankrupt U.S. territory recover from September's Hurricane Maria, according to a statement on Friday from Governor Ricardo Rossello and Jenniffer Gonzalez, Puerto Rico's nonvoting member of the U.S. Congress. Rossello said on Wednesday that Puerto Rico would get $4.9 billion to shore up its near-insolvent Medicaid system and another $2 billion or so under the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program to repair its destroyed electric grid. On Friday, Rossello and Gonzalez said the island would receive a total of $11 billion under CDBG, a program run by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The additional portion would be used to help local businesses and repair and build new homes, they said. In addition to a slow recovery from Hurricane Maria, its worst natural disaster in 90 years, Puerto Rico is navigating the largest bankruptcy in U.S. government history, with a combined $120 billion in bond and pension debt. The aid announced on Friday provides just a fraction of the $94.4 billion Rossello has said the island needs to recover from cataclysmic damage to its infrastructure and housing stock, although Puerto Rico is eligible to participate in other programs that could increase the aid to $45 billion, according to Friday's statement. Congress could also appropriate more money later. The governor has asked Congress for $46 billion in CDBG funding alone. Home damage in Puerto Rico, where the poverty rate is around 46 percent, was exacerbated by the existence of hundreds of thousands of sub-standard \"informal\" homes, which are typically built by the owners themselves, without permits and often in squatter communities. \"The work carried out in Washington - together with resident commissioner Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez - was able to deliver the message of the urgency of an allocation of funds that meets the needs of the Island,\" the governor said in Friday's statement. The disaster aid package signed by Trump on Friday - around $90 billion in total - covers a number of major disasters, including Hurricanes Irma, Harvey and Maria, as well as the recent California wildfires.

Trump tweeted last month that he had selected Haspel to replace Mike Pompeo, who is being considered to be secretary of state. But the president had not sent the formal paperwork to Capitol Hill. Logistical issues, including an FBI background check that took longer than expected, was to blame, according to a U.S. official, who was not authorized to discuss the issue and spoke only on condition of anonymity. Still, the delay prompted critics to speculate that the delay signaled the White House was having second thoughts about the nomination. Some lawmakers and human rights groups oppose Haspel\u2019s nomination because of her role in the CIA\u2019s detention and harsh interrogation of terror suspects after 9/11. The Senate intelligence committee is expected to have a confirmation hearing for Haspel in coming weeks, followed by a vote in the full Senate.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

That\u2019s the information they seek to blackout. This botched investigation is a stunning indictment of the FBI. This is not the Soviet Union, this is not Iran or Riyadh \u2013 this is America. Where is the outrage? And while the bumbling FBI has dismissed out of hand jihad as a motive, here is what we know: ISIS has claimed responsibility for the Vegas slaughter. ISIS does not claim credit for events that are not theirs. They have double and tripled down on their claim. They have said that Stephen Paddock had converted to Islam six months ago, and they revealed his Islamic name as Abu Abd Abdulbar al Ameriki. Paddock made multiple trips to the Middle East. The FBI has not spoken of his itinerary or who he met with. His girlfriend Mari Danley had relatives in Dubai. Over 200 of Paddock\u2019s foreign financial transactions were flagged for possible covert terrorism financing. Paddock transferred $100,000 to his girlfriend in the Philippines, now an ISIS foothold. Paddock removed the hard drive before he committed suicide. The San Bernardino jihad attackers did the same thing. If you recall, Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik threw their hard drives in a lake near their home, and despite Herculean efforts by law enforcement, the hard drives were never recovered. AUTHORITIES PUT BRAKES ON INFORMATION FLOW IN LAS VEGAS SHOOTING By Rachel Crosby Las Vegas Review-Journal, October 26, 2017: Fifty-eight people killed. More than 500 injured. And yet, nearly a month after the Las Vegas Strip experienced the worst mass shooting in modern American history, local and federal authorities are refusing to fill in the blanks. It wasn\u2019t always like this. In the days after Oct. 1, when Stephen Paddock opened fire on the Route 91 Harvest festival crowd from his Mandalay Bay corner suite, Las Vegas police were hosting multiple news conferences a day. Then, once a day. Then, once every few days. They compiled and released snippets of officers\u2019 body camera footage. They spent several minutes answering specific questions. They released a comprehensive timeline, which ended up being wrong. They took it back, and tried to clarify the errors, but instead caused more confusion. By Oct. 13 \u2014 the last time the Metropolitan Police Department or the FBI addressed the media or public \u2014 something had changed. The sheriff, who had been straightforward and stern, was now emotional and at times combative. Both he and the FBI failed to provide much new information, and at the end of the meeting, they refused to take questions. Since that day, the only person who has shed more light on the investigation is Mandalay Bay security guard Jesus Campos, who was shot in the leg while approaching the gunman\u2019s room. His platform to share that information? \u201cThe Ellen DeGeneres Show,\u201d which aired last week. He hasn\u2019t made himself available to the media since. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d FBI spokeswoman Sandra Breault told the Las Vegas Review-Journal on Thursday, when asked why there had been no significant updates in two weeks. \u201cIt\u2019s an ongoing investigation, and unless there\u2019s something to report, there will not be a briefing.\u201d Calls to the national FBI office were forwarded back to Breault at the Las Vegas office. At least twice this week, the Las Vegas Review-Journal has asked to speak with Sheriff Joe Lombardo about the shooting investigation. Both times, reporters were told by Carla Alston, the Police Department\u2019s director of communications, that the sheriff \u201cwill not be conducting interviews.\u201d \u201cAs he has stated previously, the case is still ongoing\u201d she said in an email Thursday. \u201cAnother media briefing will be held when we have new and accurate information.\u201d When asked when that briefing would be, Alston guessed it could occur in the next two weeks. The Review-Journal also specifically asked about the more than 50,000 hours of overtime that Metro officers have logged since Oct. 1 on work directly related to the shooting investigation. \u201cInvestigators have made progress on investigative leads and in mapping out Stephen Paddock\u2019s life for the last few years \u2014 and they\u2019re still not done,\u201d Alston said. \u201cWe still have officers dedicated to this case 24/7.\u201d She agreed that members of the public have a right to know more, \u201cbut they have a right to accurate information and not the speculation \u2026 that has filled so many news stories the past month.\u201d Nearly a month after the mass shooting, the gunman\u2019s motive remains a mystery. More straightforward questions also remain unanswered, including whether the 32nd floor of Mandalay Bay \u2014 where the gunman was staying \u2014 has surveillance cameras, and what exactly investigators collected in the gunman\u2019s hotel room and homes. Authorities also have not said how long the gunman had a \u201cdo not disturb\u201d sign on his hotel door, and whether hotel staff saw something suspicious in his room but failed to report it. Though authorities have described the investigation as a team effort, they have not explained what role Las Vegas police, the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are playing in the case.

However, it's being reported that Powell is \"not interested\" in the post, which is a good thing for Americans. Powell is on the short list of Trump's considerations to fill the position. Others on the list include Richard Grenell, the US ambassador to Germany, who previously served as a spokesman for the US Mission to the UN, and Kelly Craft, the US ambassador to Canada.

Powell, who returned to Goldman in a senior role after leaving her job as President Donald Trump\u2019s deputy national security adviser, is said to be strongly considering the job but also weighing family concerns. Powell already lives in New York, where the U.N. is based, but has young children and left the administration in part to spend more time with family. She is also said to be happy in her job at Goldman. Born in Egypt and raised in the United States, Powell is well liked by Trump as well as the president\u2019s daughter Ivanka and son-in-law, Jared Kushner. But she is already coming under criticism from some conservatives on social media who maintain that Powell is a \u201cglobalist\u201d not closely enough aligned with Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica first\u201d approach to foreign policy. Trump on Tuesday described Powell as a \u201cperson I would consider\u201d when asked about her possible nomination. \u201cShe is under consideration. We have, actually, many names,\u201d he said. However, according to Bloomberg, Powell isn't interested in the position. She says she is just fine at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. partner Dina Powell has told some colleagues that she\u2019s leaning against leaving the firm to rejoin the Trump administration as ambassador to the United Nations, according to two people familiar with the matter. President Donald Trump has called Powell about the job twice, first on Sunday -- before current United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley announced her resignation -- and again on Wednesday, the people said. He made it clear that he\u2019s interested in the idea of appointing Powell to the position, they said, though he has also talked to other candidates. Powell is not only a partner at Goldman Sachs, which has a sordid history of its own, but also worked in the George W. Bush administration. As for her ties with Goldman Sachs, Breitbart reported the following: 1 \u2013 When she served as president of the Goldman Sachs Foundation, the philanthropic arm of the Wall Street giant, Powell repeatedly partnered with the Clinton Global Initiative for a globalist women\u2019s project that served as the centerpiece of Goldman\u2019s foundation. 2 \u2013 Powell\u2019s organization joined with the Clinton Global Initiative for globalist giving projects. 3 \u2013 Powell\u2019s Goldman Sachs fund directly donated to the controversial Clinton Foundation. 4 \u2013 Powell\u2019s Goldman Sachs group worked with Hillary Clinton\u2019s State Department in a project announced by Clinton. 5 \u2013 Powell was a featured speaker at a Clinton Global Initiative event alongside Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton\u2019s former campaign chief, John Podesta. 6 \u2013 There are crossover connections between employees paid by Powell\u2019s 10,000 Women and the Clintons. 7 \u2013 Powell served on a global group alongside Hillary Clinton. 8 \u2013 In coming to Goldman Sachs, Powell joined a firm that has long been deeply tied to the Clintons. Daniel Greenfield wrote about Dina Habib Powell: \u201cThe media dubbed her the Republican Huma Abedin. She\u2019s been one of the most powerful women in two Republican administrations. She\u2019s friends with Valerie Jarrett\u2026.Habib Powell had all the right friends. Like Valerie Jarrett. Arianna Huffington praised the White House for bringing her in. Her ex-husband heads up Teneo Strategy: the organization created by the same man who made the Clinton Foundation happen and which employed Huma Abedin. You could see her posing next to Huma, Arianna and a Saudi princess. You can see her photographed at the American Task Force of Palestine gala. The ATFP was originally Rashid Khalidi\u2019s American Committee on Jerusalem. Khalidi was the former PLO spokesman at the center of the Obama tape scandal. And Habib Powell was there as a presenter at the Middle East Institute after a speech by the PLO\u2019s Hanan Ashrawi\u2026.Dina Habib Powell is a deep part of the Republican establishment. Her top role at the NSC represents McMaster\u2019s vision for our approach to Islam. And it\u2019s an echo of the failed approach of the Bush years. Flynn made the NSC into a tool that matched Trump\u2019s vision. McMaster is remaking it to match Jeb Bush\u2019s vision.\u201d Greenfield also adds: When visiting Egypt, Habib-Powell had assured the locals of how Bush, after September 11, \u201cvisited a mosque, took off his shoes and paid his respects.\u201d \u201cI see the president talk of Islam as a religion of peace, I see him host an iftar every year,\u201d she gushed. K.T. McFarland had written that \u201cGlobal Islamist jihad is at war with all of Western civilization.\u201d It\u2019s not hard to see why McMaster pushed out McFarland and elevated Habib-Powell.

Last week\u2019s Economist Magazine won the day with the best-ever headline about the Trump-Kim Jong-un summit: `Kim Jong Won!\u2019 That said it all. Just out of hospital, I was in no shape to compete with the great Economist or its very witty headline writers. But after watching a week of post Singapore summit between Great White Father Trump and delinquent Kim Jong-un I must totally agree with the Economist. What was billed as a second-coming extravaganza between the two leaders \u2013 who have been trading insults of \u2018little rocket man\u2019 and \u2018dotard\u2019 (someone who is senile) turned out to be a very expensive photo op for both publicity seekers that made much noise but produced very little \u2013 at least so far. It seemed as if two schoolyard bullies had been forced by the principal to shake hands. Beyond gestures, North Korea\u2019s leader certainly came out ahead. His objective \u2013 and those of his family predecessors for the past 60 years \u2013 was to normalize relations with the US, start trade, and end US efforts to overthrow the Marxist government in Pyongyang. American Raj: Liberati... Eric Margolis Best Price: $5.99 Buy New $45.86 (as of 09:30 EDT - Details) Trump\u2019s objectives, at least initially, were to crush North Korea and the threats it could pose to the United States and its regional allies Japan and South Korea. Trump sought to set up Kim as a bogeyman, and himself as America\u2019s savior. Trump knew perfectly well that he could not destroy all of North Korea\u2019s deeply buried nuclear-armed missiles, and, in spite of his huffing and puffing, had no stomach for an invasion of North Korea that could cost the US an estimated 250,000 casualties. So Trump\u2019s solution was more show-biz. A much ballyhooed flight to Singapore, backslapping a delighted Kim, and a love-fest between the two chunky leaders was sold to Americans as the dawn of peace. America\u2019s media was quick to retail the story and burnish Trump\u2019s credentials among the seriously credulous. No more hiding under your school desks or in dank basements. As Trump grandly proclaimed, Americans no longer have to fear North Korea and can sleep peacefully at night! Why? Korea still has all of its medium and long-ranged missiles and an estimated 40 or more nuclear warheads. The North is developing submarines that can launch nuclear-armed missiles from underwater off America\u2019s coasts. For Kim, these weapons are purely defensive, designed to prevent a US attack on his nation. But he is now a full-fledged member of the nuclear club. Equally important, North Korea still has an estimated 14,000 170mm guns and hundreds of 300mm long-ranged rocket launchers emplaced in caves just north of the Demilitarized Zone between the two Koreas. They threaten almost all of South Korea\u2019s capital Seoul north of the Han River and some US military bases and key airfields, notably Osan. This is a very real threat \u2013 one that is largely immune to attack from the air. I have seen these emplacements from the northern edge of the DMZ. Kim\u2019s big guns hold Seoul\u2019s millions of inhabitants hostage. War at the Top of the ... Eric Margolis Best Price: $2.60 Buy New $24.57 (as of 09:00 EDT - Details) There is no mention of this artillery threat in the final communiqu\u00e9 issued by Trump and Kim in Singapore. But it was agreed to temporarily stop the highly provocative US/South Korean war games simulating an invasion of the North, a key demand by Kim. This column has been calling for their end for a decade. North Korea will seemingly halt its missile tests. This is not the \u2018denuclearization\u2019 of North Korea that has been bandied about. There may be a few gestures of disarmament but Kim must know that his nukes are his means of survival. In case Kim didn\u2019t remember the dire fate of Iraq, Libya, and Syria, Trump\u2019s new national security advisor John Bolton, a fanatic\u2019s fanatic, cheerfully recalled the doom of Libya\u2019s murdered Col. Khadaffi. The Singapore summit was also a huge humiliation for America\u2019s allies Japan and South Korea. In Asia, preserving \u2018face\u2019 is essential. Trump completely ignored America\u2019s two old allies after his meeting with Kim \u2013 who routinely blasts Japan and South Korea as \u2018America\u2019s stooges.\u2019 Instead, Trump sent his beginner Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to explain what happened in Singapore, inflicting a deep loss of face on Tokyo and Seoul. This was a terrible insult and could spark decisions by at least Japan to proceed ahead with its covert nuclear program. Japan can deploy nuclear weapons in 3-6 months; South Korea is not far behind. The United States and North Korea are now on a more civilized level of behavior. But nothing basic has been resolved. Maybe Trump has some more concessions up his sleeve, like cutting the number of US troops in the South. But Korea is now on the back burner as Trump wages trade wars around the globe.

The allegations against Brett Kavanaugh \u2014 outlined now on the record in the Washington Post by Palo Alto University professor Christine Blasey Ford \u2014 are substantial and serious. She claims that Kavanaugh knocked her down, groped her, and attempted to remove her clothes. Here\u2019s the core of her story: While his friend watched, she said, Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed on her back and groped her over her clothes, grinding his body against hers and clumsily attempting to pull off her one-piece bathing suit and the clothing she wore over it. When she tried to scream, she said, he put his hand over her mouth. \u201cI thought he might inadvertently kill me,\u201d said Ford, now a 51-year-old research psychologist in northern California. \u201cHe was trying to attack me and remove my clothing.\u201d Ford said she was able to escape when Kavanaugh\u2019s friend and classmate at Georgetown Preparatory School, Mark Judge, jumped on top of them, sending all three tumbling. She said she ran from the room, briefly locked herself in a bathroom and then fled the house. Do not count me among those who would minimize this alleged assault. I went to a high school that had more than its share of drunken parties, and my classmates could do crazy and stupid things, but an act like this was beyond the pale. This isn\u2019t \u201cboys will be boys.\u201d Actions have consequences, and it\u2019s hardly unjust to tell a person that if he mistreated another human being like this \u2014 even a long time ago \u2014 he has to remain \u201cmerely\u201d a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. Since Kavanaugh has denied the story, however, the question of whether the event is so egregious that it should disqualify him is moot. At the very least, if the attack happened, he should be disqualified for lying. Yet unless all parties start telling the same story, there is no way to know for certain if this event occurred. We don\u2019t need certainty, however, to make a decision on whether a man should sit on the Supreme Court. I have the same standard for Brett Kavanaugh as I did for Roy Moore, for Donald Trump, for Bill Clinton \u2014 or for any other politician who\u2019s accused of misconduct. Is it more likely than not that the allegation is true? Given the totality of the evidence, I believe it is more likely than not that Bill Clinton committed rape and sexual harassment. I believe it is more likely than not that Donald Trump has committed sexual assault. I believe it is more likely than not that Roy Moore engaged in sexual misconduct with underage girls. But the evidence against Kavanaugh falls far short of the evidence arrayed against each of these men. So far at least it falls far short of the evidence against virtually any other politician or celebrity who has faced consequences during this #MeToo moment. Here\u2019s why: First, one way to help test the veracity of old claims is to ask whether there is any contemporaneous corroboration. Did the accuser tell a friend or family member or anyone about the alleged assault when it occurred? With Clinton, Trump, Moore, and many other politicians and celebrities, there was ample contemporaneous corroboration. Here, there was not. According to the Washington Post, \u201cFord said she told no one of the incident in any detail until 2012, when she was in couples therapy with her husband.\u201d That\u2019s almost three decades of silence \u2014 three decades when memories can grow cloudy and recollections can change. But even the allegedly corroborating notes of the therapist raise a separate problem. They actually contradict her story on a key detail. According to the Post, \u201cThe notes say four boys were involved, a discrepancy that Ford says was an error on the therapist\u2019s part. Ford said there were four boys at the party but only two in the room.\u201d Nor do the notes mention Kavanaugh\u2019s name, even though her husband says Ford named Kavanaugh in the sessions. Those are important discrepancies, and if six years ago she told the therapist four men and says two men now, that suggests that her memory of the event may be suspect. As a former trial lawyer, I can tell you that while neither notes nor memories are infallible, in a contest between contemporaneous notes and later verbal testimony about those notes, the content of the written notes usually prevails. Juries are extremely skeptical of witnesses who contradict written notes \u2014 after all, the notes are taken when the words are immediate and there isn\u2019t the overwhelming pressure of a trial to conform your testimony to the desired outcome. At least the investigation seems somewhat manageable. If there were only four boys there, who were the other two? Let\u2019s hear from them.

The AMA, which should take no political position when it comes to guns, except to uphold the law which protects the God-given rights of law-abiding citizens, came out with a lengthy blog post not only calling for guns and ammunition confiscation, as well as universal gun registration but also proposals to ban the sale and possession of \u201call assault-type weapons, bump stocks and related devices, high-capacity magazines, and armor piercing bullets.\u201d Now, the majority of people at the AMA probably couldn't tell you any of these devices or items if they saw them, but they are advancing an agenda. Just keep that in mind. take our poll - story continues below Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician? Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?

This has nothing to do with medicine or health, and far from stupid people running for Congress who spray themselves with pepper spray to tell you how it will be effective to protect your children against a criminal armed with a gun, these people don't used the word \"epidemic\" in their diatribe, though they are on record saying gun violence is a public health crisis. Sara Berg, a senior writer at AMA, was the author of the lengthy post which calls for all sorts of government overreach and unconstitutional legislation. And though she has a huge laundry list of things the AMA supports, she fails, like every other Socialist and Communist, to tell us exactly how these measures keep people safe and weapons out of the hands of criminals. Berg and the AMA want to pull a Dick's Sporting Goods and demand that people be 21 before they can purchase a firearm. Does Berg and the AMA support our military? Do they not know that 18-year-olds carry firearms, both handguns and rifles? I ask, as I do with the issue concerning alcohol, what is magic about the age of 21? I ask, where does government get to determine who gets to do whatever at whatever age based on an ambiguous age number? Yet, if we do that, we won't have to worry about mass shooters, right? Wrong. Yeah, that's gonna keep people safe. It's going to infringe on the rights of those who don't commit crimes and need a gun to protect themselves or be part of the constitutional militia. The AMA also wants to bypass the Fifth Amendment protections concerning someone actually being indicted and found guilty of a crime being deprived of their liberty and property as they promote a new legal procedure by which \u201cfamily members, intimate partners, household members and law enforcement personnel\u201d can petition courts to confiscate firearms from people \u201cwhen there is a high or imminent risk for violence.\u201d They want to do what President Donald Trump suggested and \"take the guns first\" and forget due process. See? This is why they should be honest about who they are and name themselves the Non-American Medical Association. I'm all for situations like Nikolas Cruz who assaulted teachers and students being arrested and tried and dealt with lawfully, but to go seizing people's property and denying them their liberty base on the hearsay of another person is anti-constitutional and anti-American. Who knows exactly what they mean by high-capacity magazines. I mean, for the most part, you can obtain 20 or 30 round magazines for both handguns and rifles. In some cases, you can purchase drums which hold 50-100 rounds, but if you are in New York, the NY SAFE Act defines your high capacity magazine to hold anything more than 7 rounds. As for the nonsensical call to ban armor-piercing bullets, virtually every caliber of bullet, except maybe a .22 can pierce kevlar-based vests, and if you are using .22 magnums, they will even pierce those! At the 2018 AMA Annual Meeting, delegates adopted policy for the AMA to support: Establishing laws allowing family members, intimate partners, household members and law enforcement personnel to petition a court for the removal of a firearm when there is a high or imminent risk for violence. Prohibiting persons who are under domestic violence restraining orders, convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence crimes or stalking from possessing or purchasing firearms. Expanding domestic violence restraining orders to include dating partners. Requiring states to have protocols or processes in place for requiring the removal of firearms by prohibited persons. Requiring domestic violence restraining orders and gun violence restraining orders to be entered into the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. Efforts to ensure the public is aware of the existence of laws that allow for the removal of firearms from high-risk individuals. The delegates also modified existing policy to: Recognize the role of firearms in suicides. Encourage the development of curricula and training for physicians with a focus on suicide risk assessment and prevention as well as lethal means safety counseling. Encourage physicians, as a part of their suicide prevention strategy, to discuss lethal means safety and work with families to reduce access to lethal means of suicide. Newly adopted policy also means the AMA will: Advocate for schools to remain gun-free\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

Last week, it must have been very much on Kurdish minds. As their U.S. allies watched, the Kurdish peshmerga fighters were run out of Kirkuk and all the territory they had captured fighting ISIS alongside the Americans. The Iraqi army that ran them out was trained and armed by the United States. The U.S. had warned the Kurds against holding the referendum on independence on Sept. 25, which carried with 92 percent. Iran and Turkey had warned against an independent Kurdistan that could be a magnet for Kurdish minorities in their own countries. But the Iraqi Kurds went ahead. Now they have lost Kirkuk and its oil, and their dream of independence is all but dead. More troubling for America is the new reality revealed by the rout of the peshmerga. Iraq, which George W. Bush and the neocons were going to fashion into a pro-Western democracy and American ally, appears to be as close to Iran as it is to the United States. After 4,500 U.S. dead, scores of thousands wounded and a trillion dollars sunk, our 15-year war in Iraq could end with a Shiite-dominated Baghdad aligned with Tehran. With that grim prospect in mind, Secretary Rex Tillerson said Sunday , \"Iranian militias that are in Iraq, now that the fight against ... ISIS is coming to a close ... need to go home. Any foreign fighters in Iraq need to go home.\" Tillerson meant Iran's Quds Force in Iraq should go home, and the Shiite militia in Iraq should be conscripted into the army. But what if the Baghdad regime of Haider al-Abadi does not agree? What if the Quds Force does not go home to Iran and the Shiite militias that helped retake Kirkuk refuse to enlist in the Iraqi army? Who then enforces Tillerson's demands? Consider what is happening in Syria. The U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, largely Kurdish, just annihilated ISIS in Raqqa and drove 60 miles to seize Syria's largest oil field, al-Omar, from ISIS. The race is now on between the SDF and Bashar Assad's army to secure the border with Iraq. Bottom line: The U.S. goal of crushing the ISIS caliphate is almost attained. But if our victory in the war against ISIS leaves Iran in the catbird seat in Baghdad and Damascus, and its corridor from Tehran to Baghdad, Damascus and Beirut secure, is that really a victory? Do we accept that outcome, pack up and go home? Or do we leave our forces in Syria and Iraq and defy any demand from Assad to vacate his country? Sunday's editorial in The Washington Post, \"The Next Mideast Wars,\" raises the crucial questions now before us. Would President Trump be willing to fight a new war to keep Iran from consolidating its position in Iraq and Syria? Would the American people support such a war with U.S. troops? Would Congress, apparently clueless to the presence of 800 U.S. troops in Niger, authorize a new U.S. war in Syria or Iraq? If Trump and his generals felt our vital interests could not allow Syria and Iraq to drift into the orbit of Iran, where would we find allies for such a fight? If we rely on the Kurds in Syria, we lose NATO ally Turkey, which regards Syria's Kurds as collaborators of the PKK in Turkey, which even the U.S. designates a terrorist organization. The decision as to whether this country should engage in new post-ISIS wars in the Mideast, however, may be taken out of our hands. Saturday, Israel launched new air strikes against gun positions in Syria in retaliation for shells fired into the Golan Heights. Damascus claims that Israel's \"terrorist\" allies inside Syria fired the shells, to give the IDF an excuse to attack. Why would Israel wish to provoke a war with Syria? Because the Israelis see the outcome of the six-year Syrian civil war as a strategic disaster. Hezbollah, stronger than ever, was part of Assad's victorious coalition. Iran may have secured its land corridor from Tehran to Beirut. Its presence in Syria could now be permanent. And only one force in the region has the power to reverse the present outcome of Syria's civil war--the United States. Bibi Netanyahu knows that if war with Syria breaks out, a clamor will arise in Congress to have the U.S. rush to Israel's aid. \"A failure by the United States to defend its allies or promote new political arrangements for (Syria and Iraq) will lead only to more war, the rise of new terrorist threats, and, ultimately, the necessity of more U.S. intervention.\" Closing its Sunday editorial the Post instructed the president:The interventionist Post is saying: The situation is intolerable. Confront Assad and Iran now, or fight them later. Trump is being led to the Rubicon. If he crosses, he joins Bush II in the history books. Patrick J.

In a town hall meeting this week, citizens showed that they still have a lot of questions for the Dallas Police Department in regards to the cold-blooded killing of Botham Jean. On top of questions as to why it took several days to arrest the cop \u2014 despite the fact that Guyger admitted to it \u2014 were questions like why this person who has proven to be a threat to society has yet to be fired from the police force. During the meeting, as Chief Renee Hall dodged several questions over the details of the arrest, she did go out of her way to answer the question of why Guyger is still collecting a paycheck from their department. The short of it, according to Hall, is she can\u2019t fire her. take our poll - story continues below Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?

There are civil service laws we have to adhere to,\u201d said Hall. But experts say this is not true. As WFAA reports, Justin Moore, a civil rights attorney was a panelist at the meeting and was surprised by the Chief\u2019s comments. \u201cI was completely mystified, and I really didn\u2019t understand where it came from last night. It seemed like Chief Hall might not have been well informed on the law,\u201d said Moore. WFAA went further and noted that the \u201cthe Dallas Police Department general orders do allow the chief to take action, saying, \u2018The Chief of Police may circumvent all formal disciplinary procedures to render an immediate decision when it deems it necessary to preserve the integrity of the department.\u2019\u201d Apparently, this \u201cintegrity\u201d is not worth preserving and the Dallas police are going out of their way to keep a killer cop on their payroll. As WFAA pointed out, lots of cops across the state who have been under criminal investigation have been fired by police chiefs. This includes cops within the Dallas police department. Amy Wilburn, a former Dallas cop shot an unarmed teen in the stomach as he sat down with his hands in the air in 2013. Days later, after her account was found to be entirely false, she was fired for it. Wilburn became the first cop in 41 years \u2014 since officer Darrell Cain murdered a 12-year-old boy in the back of his squad car \u2014 to be indicted for shooting a suspect. Also in 2013, officer Cardan Spencer shot a mentally ill man in his driveway. Days later, he was also fired after surveillance video proved he was lying about what happened. So why hasn\u2019t the chief fired Gugyer, who has actually been charged, arrested, and admitted to killing an innocent man? Like all those accused of a crime, Amber Guyger deserves her day in court. However, as far as her job with the department is concerned, she has already proven that she is no longer fit for duty, ever again. WFAA asked the Dallas Police Department for the laws she cited claiming that she can\u2019t fire Guyger, but they did not provide them. The department did respond about the general order mentioned by WFAA, however, saying, \u201cGeneral order 508 refers to the Police Chief\u2019s ability to circumvent the formal disciplinary procedures not the investigative process.\u201d Exactly what \u201cinvestigative process\u201d needs to happen before they can fire her remains unclear as this public servant admitted to killing an innocent man in his own home. At the very least, she should be fired for this. But then again, as we\u2019ve reported already this week, Amber Guyger is subject to a different set of rules than common citizens, which apparently includes keeping a paycheck after admitting to killing an unarmed, innocent, pillar of society, Botham Jean.

            "question": "Which of the following tactics is used in the following text?\n\nArticle: Lawyer: Ammo dealer saw nothing suspicious in Vegas gunman An Arizona man who sold ammunition to the gunman in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history was disturbed that he didn't spot any suspicious signs about his one-time customer, the man's lawyer said Wednesday. Douglas Haig had no reason to believe Stephen Paddock would launch the Oct. 1 shooting in Las Vegas that killed 58 people, attorney Marc Victor said. He said Haig wishes he could have figured out the intentions of Paddock but defends the sale of ammunition as legal. \"He wishes there was some clue that could have identified him,\" Victor said. \"There was just nothing.\" Meanwhile, the coroner in Las Vegas started releasing redacted autopsy records about the 58 people killed in the mass shooting at an outdoor concert. Records relating to Paddock were not being provided. The records were released Wednesday in response to a public records lawsuit filed by The Associated Press and Las Vegas Review-Journal. Haig was named as a \"person of interest\" in the investigation by mistake Tuesday when court documents were released nearly four months after the shooting. The documents did not disclose why authorities considered Haig a person of interest, and officials haven't said whether he has since been cleared of that designation. Victor said his client sold ammunition to Paddock once and doesn't believe they have communicated since. \"He is as connected (to Paddock) as the guy who sold him a hamburger for lunch,\" Victor said. Las Vegas police and officials with the FBI, U.S. attorney's office in Nevada and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives each declined Wednesday to comment about Haig or the investigation. A law enforcement official told The Associated Press in October that Paddock bought 1,000 rounds of tracer ammunition from a private seller he met at a Phoenix gun show three weeks before the shooting. The official spoke anonymously because they weren't authorized to disclose case information. Tracer bullets contain a pyrotechnic charge that illuminates the path of fired bullets so shooters can see whether their aim is correct. Haig told the AP on Tuesday that he sold unspecified ammunition to Paddock. He also told \"CBS This Morning\" on Wednesday that he sold more than 700 rounds of ammunition to Paddock. \"I couldn't detect anything wrong with this guy,\" he said of Paddock. The ammunition sale took place at Haig's home in Mesa, because he didn't have all the ammunition on hand that Paddock wanted while at the gun show. Victor said a box that Paddock used to carry ammunition out of Haig's house and bore his client's name was later found in the Las Vegas hotel where the attack was launched. It's unknown whether the ammunition Haig sold to Paddock was used in the attack. The lawyer said the type and quantity of ammunition Paddock bought from his client wasn't unusual. Robert Spitzer, an expert on firearms and the Second Amendment, said by and large there are no restrictions on the amount of ammunition a person can buy, but a large sale of tracer ammunition would certainly be unusual. Only six states in the U.S. have laws requiring that ammunition buyers pass a background check. Arizona and Nevada do not have such a requirement, nor do they mandate that dealers keep a record of ammunition transactions. \"If you are in the business of selling anything, you are usually happy to make the sale, and there's nothing that says you need to write down this person's name or report the sale,\" said Spitzer, who is the chairman of political science at the State University of New York at Cortland. Victor said his client has cooperated with investigators who contacted him within 24 hours of the shooting and has spoken to them probably four or five times, though he hasn't talked to them in months. Haig describes himself as a senior engineer for Honeywell Aerospace in his biography on the professional and social media platform LinkedIn. Records show Haig also owns Specialized Military Ammunition LLC. The company's website says it sold tracer and incendiary ammunition but is now \"closed indefinitely.\" Haig's name was blacked out in the more than 270 pages of search warrant records released by a Nevada judge to the AP, but remained on one page of documents provided to the Las Vegas Review-Journal. The newspaper published the name online. Clark County District Court Judge Elissa Cadish later ordered the full document not be published without redactions, but she acknowledged she couldn't order the newspaper to retract the name. Haig plans to hold a news conference Friday to discuss his interaction with Paddock. Garcia Cano reported from Las Vegas. Associated Press writers Ken Ritter in Las Vegas and Anita Snow in Phoenix contributed to this report. Billeaud reported from Phoenix.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

However, when asked by Senator Cory Booker whether or not Kavanaugh thought Ford was part of what Kavanaugh referred to as a \"political hit\" against him, Kavanaugh rightly steered clear of a public relations disaster. However, I am willing to say would he would not: Of course, she was part of it! I don't say this lightly. There are many things that we heard from Ford on Thursday that indicate there is more going on than she was willing to say. Clearly, Ford has been outed as a radical political activist who promotes baby murder and other unlawful actions. However, her story didn't exactly lend credibility except with Democrat members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, one of which has openly professed to sexual assault. take our poll - story continues below Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?

However, Ford claims she never authorized her July letter to Senator Feinstein to be made public and yet, it was. She didn't seem distraught over that. She wasn't angry it was made public. Why? She knew it would be made public. Ricki Seidman, a Democratic operative and former Clinton White House official who is now an advisor to Mrs. Ford, said in July (at roughly the same time as the letter was submitted) that she predicted a \"strategy\" forming to destroy Brett Kavanaugh. She suggested a \u201cstrategy will emerge\u201d to destroy Trump's nomination for the Supreme Court in a conference call with the American Constitution Society in July. \u201cI do think that over the coming days and weeks there will be a strategy that will emerge, and I think it\u2019s possible that strategy might ultimately defeat the nominee,\u201d Seidman said in audio that was recorded by the Republican National Committee\u2019s War Room. \u201cAnd whether or not it ultimately defeats the nominee it will, I think, help people understand why it\u2019s so important that they vote.\u201d If you think Mrs. Ford is ignorant of this considering her father works for the Central Intelligence Agency and her prior criminal political activism, then you aren't thinking clearly. Ford obviously has mental issues and that was on display on Thursday during her testimony. She clearly tried to present herself as a victim while she accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault with absolutely no evidence. Kavanaugh even responded by pointing out that even her friends said they don't recall such an incident and had literally hundreds of people commend his character as the direct opposite of what Ford claims. As I've said before, I don't support Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court on the grounds of lack of constitutional rulings, but that attack on him was orchestrated, it was political and Ford was a part of it. It's wrong. Ford didn't even think to act, according to her testimony, until Kavanaugh was on the short list, but did she go to local law enforcement? Nope. She went to her US Democrat representative, Senator Dianne Feinstein and The Washington Post. If that is not political, I don't know what is. Ford is not seeking justice nor is she seeking to do her \"civic duty.\" She is seeking to slander a man's character for something she cannot prove that she claims happened over 36 years ago. Kavanaugh's nomination was passed out of committee on Friday and will go to the Senate floor for a confirmation vote. For a quick run down of the political hit on Kavanaugh, take a look at this short synopsis by Paul Joseph Watson.

However, as Michael Ahrens of GOP.com tweeted, Ellison knew what kind of man Farrakhan was then and what kind of man he still is today.

Mohamad Khweis, unlike the dozens of other people in the United States who failed to join ISIS and were subsequently charged, actually made it to Syria, but after just three months tried to escape and was captured by Kurdish forces, The Washington Post reports. Khweis is an interesting case for numerous reasons. First, there was no particular event or friend who ignited his radicalization. Second, he successfully made it to Syria via Turkey. And third, he came from a secular home that was stable. His life before joining the caliphate was unremarkable. He obtained an associate\u2019s degree in criminal justice and worked as a bus driver in Alexandria, Va. He also abused marijuana over the past few years. Khweis\u2019 defense attorney said Friday that even he has no idea what caused Khweis to join ISIS. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to understand,\u201d defense attorney John Zwerling said Friday. \u201cWe don\u2019t really know what caused him to travel to Syria.\u201d From the very start of his trial, Khweis said he regretted his actions and said his decision to join ISIS in December 2015 was a drunken one. \u201cI hated myself for making the worst decision I ever made,\u201d Khweis wrote to the judge in a letter. \u201cI ruined my life and my family\u2019s life.\u201d Prosecutors, who pushed for 35 years in prison, accused Khweis of lying repeatedly over the last 15 months of the trial. When Khweis was first captured in Iraq in March 2016, he told the FBI that he was following a young woman. However, that young woman didn\u2019t exist. \u201cThis defendant executed his plan to perfection,\u201d prosecutor Dennis Fitzpatrick said. \u201cHe got into the Islamic State.

The constant hand-wringing, from the left-wing media, over President Trump\u2019s loyalties and his connection with Russia is just silly. The media has been hanging on every word the President says and arguing that his rhetoric is proof positive that he is some kind of Russian mole. The only problem with this thesis? Everything that the President is DOING belies their argument. If President Trump were a mole, wouldn\u2019t he have made life easier for Putin? Wouldn\u2019t he have eased sanctions? Wouldn\u2019t he have been less confrontational than Obama in Syria? Wouldn\u2019t the President be making Putin\u2019s attempts at expanding his influence easier? take our poll - story continues below Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?

You also agree to this site's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use. Instead, President Trump\u2019s POLICIES have actually made life more difficult for Putin at every turn. Here\u2019s The Federalist\u2019s Mollie Hemingway explaining: Our relationship with Russia is at a significant low point where just having some conversations can lead us to a better outcome. And there are so many important things that they are involved with that we care about, whether it\u2019s Syria, Ukraine, North Korea or nuclear arms. I\u2019m kind of surprised there\u2019s been this much angst over this press conference. Not that he said things the way he should have. President Trump really did mess up with that press conference but I don\u2019t quite know what people want. He actually is pretty tough on Russia. And in the last couple of years, we\u2019ve seen an increase in the military budget, we\u2019ve seen an increase in the intelligence budget. We are doing NATO exercises in the Baltics. We provided legal aid to Ukraine and Georgia. We\u2019re developing low-yield nuclear weapons. He implemented sanctions that were even stronger than required by Congressional mandate. So if you care about actual actions, I think there\u2019s a lot to be happy about in terms of a tough posture towards Russia. People are obsessed about words and they should maybe focus on the actions as well. Former Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, concurred with Hemingway arguing that by any standard Trump has been far tougher on Russia than Obama was. First, the very people who have been loudest in attacking President Trump about his performance at the Helsinki summit are the people who failed to protect America from Russian meddling in 2016. The very intensity and nastiness of former CIA Director Brennan and former Director of National Intelligence Clapper is an attempt to distract attention from their failure to protect America. It was their duty in 2016 \u2013 not candidate Trump\u2019s. Second, the Trump administration has been far tougher on Russia than President Obama ever dreamed of being. The Trump administration is taking real actions designed to weaken Russia and force Putin to change his aggressive behavior. The Trump administration has levied tough sanctions on Russia. Also, President Trump\u2019s public lecture about Germany not buying natural gas from Russia was aimed at cutting Putin off from hard currency worth tens of billions of dollars and further weakening the Russian economy. Furthermore, President Trump\u2019s efforts to get our European allies to increase their defense spending has a direct impact on Putin. The stronger NATO is, the less maneuvering room Russia has. Beyond pressuring our allies, consider these specific steps President Trump has taken against Russia: Where President Obama refused to provide serious weapons to the Ukrainians to help them defend themselves (his response was weakness on a pathetic scale), President Trump has approved the sale of offensive weapons to enable the Ukrainians to increase the cost of Russian aggression. When the Russians used chemical weapons in Great Britain, President Trump joined our allies and expelled 60 Russian intelligence officers from the United States. When the Russians retaliated, the Trump administration closed the Russian consulate in Seattle. President Trump had previously shuttered the Russian consulate in San Francisco and smaller annexes in Washington and New York. More than 100 Russian individuals and companies have been sanctioned for a variety of reasons. Despite the hysteria of the left, it is impossible to see the Trump administration as anything but firm in its dealing with Russia. Nothing done in Helsinki made life easier for the Putin regime in its continued economic decay and diplomatic isolation due to the sanctions regime. Any intellectually honest review of the last decade of foreign policy would lead one to admit that President Trump has most assuredly been tougher on Putin and Russia than Obama ever was.

            "question": "Which of the following tactics is used in the following text?\n\nArticle: SPECIAL REPORT: Pope Francis Accused of Inaction in Notorious Sex Abuse Cases The incident was brief: on the Thursday of the pope\u2019s week-long South American trip, in response to an impromptu question tossed out by a Chilean reporter, the pope responded in what one reporter described as a \u201csnippy tone\u201d: \u201cThe day I see proof against Bishop Barros, then I will talk. There is not a single piece of evidence against him. It is all calumny. Is that clear?\u201d This month has been quite a spectacle, even for this pontificate; an apparently unending stream of outrages and embarrassments, with the pope and his Vatican media support jumping from one scandal to the next. But among secular reporters the sex abuse issue trumps all others and the fallout continues to blaze down on the Bergoglian pontificate in response to his amazing accusation earlier this month that victims of sexual abuse by clergy were engaging in \u201ccalumny,\u201d in their accusations against a Chilean bishop, Juan de la Cruz Barros Madrid. It seems the shine is coming off the papal penny among leftist secular journalists, his natural constituency. Writing for the Boston Globe, the paper that first broke the clerical sex abuse scandals all the way back in 2001, Kevin Cullen wrote, \u201cLet the record show that the promise of Pope Francis died in Santiago, Chile, on Jan. 18, in the year of our Lord 2018\u2026 he has revealed himself like no one else could.\u201d But it gets worse than this. When a \u201cleftist\u201d pope pressing a secularist agenda on the Church starts to lose the support of Michael Sean Winters and the National Catholic Reporter, he must know he\u2019s in trouble. Though he\u2019s \u201csticking with Francis\u201d for now, Winters wrote, \u201cI wish I knew what it was about Pope Francis that makes him fail to grasp the situation with Bishop Barros, the pain caused to the victims and the damage done to the church. I am gobsmacked that the pope twice declined to accept the bishop\u2019s resignation.\u201d On January 23rd, an unsigned NCR editorial opined, \u201cWithin the space of four days, Pope Francis twice slandered abuse survivors.\u201d \u201cThese remarks are at the least shameful. At the most, they suggest that Francis now could be complicit in the cover-up. The script is all too familiar: Discredit the survivors\u2019 testimony, support the prelate in question, and bank on public attention moving on to something else. \u201cThe insistence with which Francis defends Barros is mystifying. Three separate journalists on the papal flight gave the pope opportunity to say why exactly he believed the bishop instead of the survivors accusing him. The second journalist to ask Francis about Barros on the flight was a Chilean woman. As she spoke to the pope, her voice cracked with nervousness at questioning the church\u2019s top leader. She asked: \u2018Why are not the victims\u2019 testimonies proof for you? Why do you not believe them?\u2019 The pope gave no satisfying answer, only repeating a claim of \u2018no evidence\u2019 against the bishop.\u201d Indeed, it was understood, as the Washington Post said, that Francis\u2019 trip to Latin America \u2013 dogged by protests over Barros both in person at the pope\u2019s appearances and in the press \u2013 was in part intended as \u201can apology tour\u201d to abuse survivors. Which is why his accusation of calumny against those same victims the next day came as such a shock to observers unused to Bergoglio\u2019s ability to turn on a dime. All was going as planned. On Wednesday, January 17, the pope met as scheduled with selected survivors of sexual abuse by priests. He made all the right noises, talking about his \u201cpain and shame,\u201d and reportedly even crying, at what happened. \u201cI know the pain of these cases of child abuse and I am following how much is needed to overcome this serious and painful evil,\u201d he said. 24 hours later he was calling them liars. James Hamilton, 49 and now a doctor, was one of the Barros accusers. He told the BBC at a press conference, \u201cWhat the Pope has done today is offensive and painful, and not only against us, but against everyone seeking to end the abuses.\u201d The lead voice of the victims in Chile, Juan Carlos Cruz, tweeting to one of Francis\u2019s leading apologists, Austen Ivereigh, said, \u201cDoes he need a photo, a selfie, as proof? Sorry Austen, we didn\u2019t think of it as we were being abused and Juan Barros watching.\u201d Although the issue came to the attention of a much broader audience during the most recent papal trip, the outcry has been ongoing since his appointment to the southern Chilean diocese of Osorno in 2015. Barros was a student prot\u00e9g\u00e9e of the charismatic homosexual/pederast predator Fernando Karadima, and went on to be ordained in 1984, made bishop in 1995 and appointed as bishop of the armed forces. Barros claimed in court that the first he knew of Karadima\u2019s offenses was on a Chilean television programme in 2010. This is refuted by Karadima\u2019s victims \u2013 deemed credible both by the secular courts and the Vatican tribunal \u2013 who testified that he personally witnessed the abuse at Sacred Heart of Jesus church in Santiago. Last Thursday, however, was not the first time Francis, confronted unexpectedly in public over the Barros question, has responded testily and with insults. In 2015 the Italian newspaper Il Fatto Quotidiano published a video of him scolding two women who spoke with him in St. Peter\u2019s Piazza, asking that he reconsider the appointment, citing the \u201csuffering\u201d of the Church in Chile over the issue. The pope told the women, \u201cThe Church has lost its freedom, letting its head fill with politicians and accusing a bishop without having any proof, after twenty years of service, so think with your head.\u201d He warned them not to allow themselves to be led by \u201cleftists who have set up this thing.\u201d \u201cThe only charge against this bishop has been discredited by\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

President Trump insisted on significant improvements to the Joint Plan of Comprehensive Action (JCPOA), as the deal is formally known. The JCPOA\u2019s fundamental flaws that President Trump wants fixed include Iran\u2019s ability to block unfettered international inspections, the wiggle room that Iran is exploiting to continue developing and testing ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons, and the sunset clause on nuclear enrichment that would provide Iran a clear path to becoming a nuclear armed state after the current restrictions are lifted. Obama and Kerry had promised that these issues would be dealt with satisfactorily before agreeing to the final terms of the JCPOA. Instead they caved to Iranian pressure in order to get the deal done. Now that President Trump is trying to clean up the mess Obama and Kerry left him, Kerry has the gall to label President Trump\u2019s decision a \"reckless abandonment of facts in favor of ego and ideology\" and to accuse the Trump administration of \u201clying to the American people.\u201d It was the Obama administration that recklessly abandoned the facts in pressing ahead with the deal. The Obama administration lied to the American people, abandoning its own promises to ensure that the deal contained ironclad protections. Moreover, all that President Trump has done so far is to return the JCPOA to Congress for review. Had Obama followed the Constitution and submitted the JCPOA to the Senate as a treaty in the first place, the JCPOA in its present form almost certainly would not have been approved. Congress should now have the opportunity to revisit the JCPOA to determine whether the protections that the Obama administration promised are working as advertised. Congress should also consider whether time limits on Iran\u2019s commitments continue to make sense in light of what we are now experiencing with Iran\u2019s nuclear technology collaborator, North Korea. It bought time to turn into a full-fledged nuclear power under our noses. Kerry had promised that the Iranian regime would be prohibited from testing ballistic missiles. This turned out to be a lie. After the JCPOA was finalized, with no such prohibition included, Iran continued to test such missiles. The Obama administration\u2019s response was that the missiles had become a separate issue, to be dealt with under a new United Nations Security Council resolution endorsing the JCPOA. The new resolution replaced clear prohibitions imposed on Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program with a weak declaration in an annex that simply \u201ccalls upon\u201d Iran not to undertake any activity such as development and test launches related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons for eight years. Iran has tested several ballistic missiles during the last two years, including two Qadr H missiles with the phrase \u201cIsrael must be wiped out\u201d emblazoned on the sides. The commander of Iran\u2019s Army, Major General Ataollah Salehi, had told reporters just a month before the launch of those missiles that Iran was \"neither paying any attention to the resolutions against Iran, nor implementing them. This is not a breach of the JCPOA.\u201d Russian Ambassador to the United Nations Vitaly Churkin, spurning requests from Obama administration officials to impose sanctions against Iran under the Security Council resolution, asserted that the Iranian missile test did not violate the resolution. \u201cA call is different from a ban so legally you cannot violate a call, you can comply with a call or you can ignore the call, but you cannot violate a call,\u201d the Russian ambassador said. In short, the JCPOA did not cover the missile tests and the replacement UN Security Council resolution that did mention the missiles is toothless. Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes told CNN, during an interview aired on April 6, 2015, that under the deal\u2019s terms then still being negotiated, \u201cyou will have anywhere, anytime, 24/7 access as it relates to the nuclear facilities that Iran has.\" Rhodes claimed that \u201cif we see a site that we need to inspect on a military facility, we can get access to that site and inspect it. So if it's a suspicious site that we believe is related to its nuclear efforts, we can get access and inspect that site through the IAEA.\u201d This was another lie. After the JCPOA was finalized in July 2015, Rhodes shamelessly denied that anytime, anywhere inspections were ever considered as part of the negotiations. \u201cWe never sought in this negotiation the capacity for so-called anytime, anywhere,\u201d Rhodes said on July 14, 2015. The JCPOA\u2019s supporters, including Kerry, have made much of the fact that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has on several occasions verified Iran\u2019s compliance with its commitments under the JCPOA, keeping its stock of low-enriched uranium below the limit set forth in the JCPOA and not pursuing further construction of the Arak reactor. Iran was found to have slightly exceeded the limit on its stock of heavy water, but has remedied the problem to the IAEA\u2019s satisfaction. IAEA chief Yukiya Amano reiterated in a statement he issued on October 9th that Iran has remained in compliance with its JCPOA commitments. The problem, as any clear-eyed observer of the process recognizes, is that the IAEA relies on Iran for self-inspection of certain sites that the regime does not want the IAEA to inspect freely on its own. IAEA inspectors have avoided examining military sites it knows exists and has no reliable way of tracking undeclared sites. The IAEA\u2019s explanation for not visiting any of Iran\u2019s known military sites is that it had \u201cno reason to ask\u201d for access. Evidently, the IAEA is supposed to block out the fact that Iran had conducted tests relevant to nuclear bomb detonations at a military site before the JCPOA\u2019s finalization in\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

No other Catholic prelate has conducted such a blanket purge of his predecessors' legacies, The New York Times reports. \u00a9 Claudio Reyes/AFP/Getty Images Catholic Church deals with sex abuse fallout At the same time, Gainer released the names of 71 clergy and seminarians who've been credibly accused of sexual misconduct involving children dating back to 1947, apologized on behalf of the diocese and himself, waived any confidentiality agreements abuse survivors may have signed in legal settlements with the diocese, and released new guidelines for protecting children in the church. Grainer said he wanted to release the list of accused predators earlier but was asked to wait until a state grand jury inquiry into abuse in six Pennsylvania Catholic diocese, including Harrisburg, was complete. A spokesman for Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro, who ordered the two-year investigation of Catholic sex abuse, said the Harrisburg diocese had pushed to end the grand jury investigation last year. The grand jury's findings, including allegations against more than 300 priests accused of sexual abuse dating back to 1947, will likely be released this month after the state Supreme Court gave the green light. The Catholic Church is already reeling over the revelations that former Washington Archbishop Theodore McCormick, who resigned as a cardinal over the weekend after being sanctioned by Pope Francis, has been credibly accused of sexually abusing at least two boys decades ago.

She is one of many Federal District Court Judges who want to run immigration policy, despite the fact that the Constitution gives authority over immigration to Congress, and Congress has allocated considerable authority to the President. This writer exposed her attempted violation of the Constitution after she initially stopped the deportation of a number of Indonesians back to Indonesia as she saw it unjust and decided to substitute her moral judgment for the laws of the United States. Kritarch Patti Saris Federal courts do not have direct authority over immigration matters, which are handled by the Executive Office for Immigration Review, but Chief Judge Patti Saris of the US District Court in Boston wrote in a court filing on Wednesday that she has a say over the terms of his confinement. US Judge Rejects Bid to Dismiss Indonesian Immigrant's Lawsuit, Jakarta Globe/Reuters, October 25, 2017 \"The district court holds jurisdiction to review habeas [corpus] challenges to unlawful immigration detention,\" Saris wrote. Writs of habeas corpus challenge illegal detention. At a Friday hearing, Saris expressed concern that ICE had broken its word with Rombot after telling him in 2015 that he would \"be given an opportunity to prepare for an orderly departure\" before being deported. She also expressed concern he was being held alongside potentially violent criminals. Her problem though was that the law and precedent are on the side of the continued deportation of aliens. Kritarch Saris has apparently seen the SCOTUS writing on the wall, and perhaps had an attack of her legal conscience and decided that she will acquiesce on the major issue, but fight on a minor issue. Commonly this the pattern of Judges who don't want to be overruled as frequently as 9th Circuit Judges do. Saris has apparently decided to bend to the inevitable in the case of Indonesians, who had years of hearings and appeals, all to naught, but do a little sabotage instead.However, she will not let it go quietly into the night.What we have here is that Saris realized she has no authority over the deportation of illegal aliens, but she will do her best to throw a wrench in the works by attempting to get illegal aliens released from custody, so they can then disappear into the United States and consequently not be deported. (a) Arrest, detention, and release On a warrant issued by the Attorney General, an alien may be arrested and detained pending a decision on whether the alien is to be removed from the United States. Except as provided in subsection (c) and pending such decision, the Attorney General\u2014(1) may continue to detain the arrested alien One of the immigrants, Terry Helmuth Rombot, has been in federal custody since appearing for an August check-in. Lawyers submitted a letter to him from ICE saying that as part of the 2010 deal he would be allowed to leave the country in an \u201corderly\u201d way. \u201cICE decided that the most orderly way for him to depart was for us to remove him,\u201d Stevens said. Saris expressed a dim view of that move. \u201cThe government broke a promise,\u201d Saris said. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing I\u2018m concerned about here.\u201d U.S. Judge Wrestles With Issue Of Indonesian Immigrants, by Scott Malone, Reuters, October 20, 2017 However, the law is quite clear, the United States has the authority to detain illegal aliens; T itle 8 of the United States Code, Section 1226, Arrest And Detention Of Aliens , gives such authority to the Executive Branch.And despite her realization that she has no authority over immigration policy, or that she will just be overruled, Saris again reaches, basing her assumption of authority over immigration based on the past Obama Regime Administrative Amnesty , when illegal aliens weren't deported.Kritarch Saris is in the wrong on both counts; she has neither authority over the detention of illegal aliens nor any authority to continue the Obama Regime Administrative Amnesty. She is like Derrick Kahala Watson , a treasonous kritarch, unwilling to submit her hunger for power and ideology to the Constitution and the law. Impeachment for her and Watson is the solution.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

The Pope Is Now Openly Attacking Child Sexual Abuse Victims For \u201cSlander\u201d Pope Francis is now attacking the credibility of child sex abuse victims in a shocking move made at the end of a trip to Chile in which he had hoped to \u201cheal\u201d the wounds of said abuse. That\u2019s right, Pope Francis ended his trip by publicly defending a bishop who victims have accused of covering up widespread pedophilia in the country. According to a report by the Associated Press, Francis made the shocking comments in a discussion about Rev. Fernando Karadima who has been found guilty of sexually abusing a slew of minors as a member of the Catholic Church. Pope Francis accused victims of Chile\u2019s most notorious pedophile of slander Thursday, an astonishing end to a visit meant to help heal the wounds of a sex abuse scandal that has cost the Catholic Church its credibility in the country. Francis said that until he sees proof that Bishop Juan Barros was complicit in covering up the sex crimes of the Rev. Fernando Karadima, such accusations against Barros are \u201call calumny.\u201d The pope\u2019s remarks drew shock from Chileans and immediate rebuke from victims and their advocates. They noted the accusers were deemed credible enough by the Vatican that it sentenced Karadima to a lifetime of \u201cpenance and prayer\u201d for his crimes in 2011. A Chilean judge also found the victims to be credible, saying that while she had to drop criminal charges against Karadima because too much time had passed, proof of his crimes wasn\u2019t lacking. [\u2026] The Karadima scandal dominated Francis\u2019 visit to Chile and the overall issue of sex abuse and church cover-up was likely to factor into his three-day trip to Peru that began late Thursday. Karadima\u2019s victims reported to church authorities as early as 2002 that he would kiss and fondle them in the swank Santiago parish he ran, but officials refused to believe them. Only when the victims went public with their accusations in 2010 did the Vatican launch an investigation that led to Karadima being removed from ministry. The emeritus archbishop of Santiago subsequently apologized for having refused to believe the victims from the start. One of the victims made clear his disgust at Pope Francis for essentially covering up for a man who watched as another bishop sexually abused him. \u201cAs if I could have taken a selfie or a photo while Karadima abused me and others and Juan Barros stood by watching it all,\u201d tweeted Juan Carlos Cruz. \u201cThese people are truly crazy, and the pontiff talks about atonement to the victims. Nothing has changed, and his plea for forgiveness is empty.\u201d This obviously does not look good for the Pope or the Catholic Church as they are now apparently engaging in attacking the victims instead of actually going after the abusers.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

The latest outrage perpetrated by BDS activists occurred at McGill University, where a Jewish student and two non-Jewish students identified as pro-Israel were removed from their positions as directors of the Students Society of McGill University (SSMU). At the end of his second year, Noah Lew, who is currently third year undergraduate student at McGill University, applied to serve as Director of the School\u2019s student society. He was warned by others who had prior dealings with the SSMU, to keep his Jewish identity secret lest he sabotage his chances. This is the atmosphere that Jewish students and supporters of Israel must endure on a daily basis at McGill. The toxic environment is due almost exclusively to an active and vocal presence of BDS agitators on campus. Lew followed the advice and was elected as a board member. His \u201csecret\u201d was intact. BDS provocateurs at McGill had relentlessly tried and failed to pass boycott resolutions against Israel. In fact, three attempts within an 18-month period were quashed. Finally, in June 2016, SSMU\u2019s Judicial Board ruled that the BDS campaign and efforts to institute it at McGill ran counter to the McGill\u2019s undergraduate student union constitution. The Board\u2019s ruling, which is called a \u201creference,\u201d was then referred to SSMU\u2019s directors for ratification. SSMU\u2019s Board of Directors addressed the issue more than a year after the \u201creference.\u201d Lew and other board members passionately advocated in favor of ratification and their arguments ultimately prevailed over the naysayers. The malevolent BDS campaign at McGill had belatedly come to an ignominious end; or so we thought. Lew and two other directors identified as either Jewish or pro-Israel became instant targets of a campaign of hate laced with blatant anti-Semitic overtones. Campus BDS groups held several meetings to formulate a response and founded the so-called \u201cDemocratize SSMU\u201d movement. But Democratize SSMU was anything but democratic. Its raison d'\u00eatre was to seek the removal of Jewish and anti-BDS students from SSMU\u2019s Board of Directors and place BDS back on the agenda. As an aside, one of the more vocal proponents of BDS at McGill is a rancid character named Igor Sadikov, who in February posted a comment on twitter advocating violence against \u201cZionists.\u201d As a result, he was forced to resign his position as an SSMU director but dodged an impeachment effort to have him stripped of his position at McGill\u2019s Arts Undergraduate Society. Sadikov made light of his \u201cpunch a Zionist\u201d tweet calling it a \u201cmisguided joke.\u201d It does not appear that Sadikov was subjected to any form of school disciplinary action despite the fact that his call for violence violated McGill\u2019s Code of Conduct. McGill\u2019s BDS Action Network actively campaigned against Lew and two other board members because of their links to Jewish groups and anti-BDS stances. Democratize SSMU shamefully highlighted Lew\u2019s ethnicity as a reason for his removal. An enlightened, progressive school was suddenly transformed into something harking back to the days of Nazi Germany and the Nuremberg Laws. In October, SSMU\u2019s General Assembly moved to ratify the 12-member Board of Directors. According to Lew, \u201chistorically, the Board of Directors had been ratified as a bloc, all 12 at a time.\u201d But BDS activists who showed up for the General Assembly ratification forced the voting to occur on an individual basis rather than a block as was the accepted protocol. In this manner, BDS/ Democratize SSMU activists managed to pick off their opponents one at a time. It was repulsive display leftist-fascist bigotry at its worst. The bigoted BDS provocateurs applauded as Lew and the other two board members were removed from their posts. But this time, they may have gone too far. Even by BDS standards, their manifestly anti-Semitic campaign antics were beyond the pale. BDS activists generally avoid reference to \u201cJews\u201d by name because it is impolitic and commonly substitute \u201cZionists\u201d for Jews even though most of us are cognizant of their true intentions. But in the instant case, McGill\u2019s BDS campaigners dispensed with their traditional charade and overtly launched their attack against Jews. The vitriolic BDS campaign immediately sparked outrage among watchdog groups and politicians prompting McGill principal, Suzanne Fortier, to announce that the school would be conducting an investigation into the matter. Even SSMU president, Muna Tojiboeva, voiced support for Lew and expressed the belief that antisemitism played a key role in the ousting the three board members. One can only hope that Fortier takes the issue seriously and conducts a proper investigation, which leads to disciplinary action. Judging by past \u201cinvestigations\u201d conducted by other schools \u2013 SFSU, CUNY and UCI, to name a few \u2013 I am not optimistic.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

The 59th victim, who is currently unnamed by the completely botched investigation and cover-up, was shot and killed in the parking lot of nearby business during the attack. The woman\u2019s lifeless body can be seen being drug across the parking lot by several men who placed the body behind a pick-up truck while the gunfire continued. The event was reported by Intellihub\u2019s Shepard Ambellas on Nov. 11, 2017, in the article titled Private surveillance footage reveals \u201chelicopter hovering overhead\u201d at time of Las Vegas Massacre, FBI never asked for tape, after an excerpt of the footage aired on Tucker Carlson Tonight. At 10:16 p.m., two men drag a \u201cfallen victim\u201d across the parking lot. The men position the victim behind a Ford pickup truck, presumably to shield themselves and the victim from taking any further incoming rounds as they attempted to give the victim medical assistance. \u201cLater at ten-twenty-four p.m., one of the men places his shirt across the victim\u2019s face and then at ten-thirty-two a man places what appears to be a blanket or towel over the body after they had given up hope,\u201d Tucker Carlson said. \u201cPolice only arrive in this area for the first time around ten-forty-five p.m. when the body is still there.\u201d The victim\u2019s body was eventually was loaded into the back of a Ford Raptor pickup truck at 11:50 p.m. and taken away. Astonishingly, between the times of 10:13 p.m. and 10:16 p.m. a good amount of debris can be seen being pushed downward and sideways in front of the camera which Carlson claims is from a \u201chelicopter hovering overhead.\u201d A quick review of flight records during that time reveals that a squadron of EC-130 Eurocopters departed from Maverick Leasing LLC at 10:12 p.m., several of which appear to have overflown the parking lot where the victim and debris were seen. However, the departure of the choppers and the fact that several of them overflew the parking lot does not explain all of the debris being kicked up from by a heavy downdraft, prop wash, possibly from a helicopter hovering in place much closer. In fact, the downdraft appears to be constant from 10:13-10:16 p.m. and not intermittent as if several choppers had just passed overhead. According to Carlson, the owner of the tape maintains that law enforcement investigators have never asked to see the footage. A preliminary report on the shooting released by the LVMPD on Friday only lists seven victims as being \u201cplaced\u201d outside of the venue, two of which were over a half mile away. However, the official report failed to catalogue the dead woman who was shot in the parking lot of a Haven Street business. The following image is taken from page 34 of the LVMPD preliminary report which shows the seven victims and their locations of death numbered in yellow. The next photo shows where the unnamed victim was located. The victim can be seen being dragged in the following video. The following day, several men, one of which presumably was Fox News anchor Sean Hannity (who was heavily guarded by a five-man security team), received mobile haircuts in the very same parking lot, in nearly the same spot the victim\u2019s body was dragged to.

It is not immediately clear how and when the documents will be released, but by Monday evening, intelligence agencies said they had already begun working to prepare the documents. \u201cWhen the President issues such an order, it triggers a declassification review process that is conducted by various agencies within the intelligence community, in conjunction with the White House Counsel, to seek to ensure the safety of America\u2019s national security interests,\u201d a Justice Department spokesperson said in a statement to Fox News. \u201cThe Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are already working with the Director of National Intelligence to comply with the President\u2019s order.\u201d ODNI spokeswoman Kellie Wade also said that the agency was \u201cworking expeditiously with our interagency partners to conduct a declassification review of the documents the President has identified for declassification.\u201d The documents include all FBI reports on interviews, also known as 302s, with Justice Department official Bruce Ohr and all FBI reports of interviews prepared in connection with applications to surveil Carter Page, as well as 21 pages of one renewed warrant. The 21 pages make up only a small portion of the 412 pages of FISA applications and warrants related to Page released by the FBI earlier this year in a heavily redacted format. The June 2017 application was the last of four filed by the Justice Department in support of FISA court orders allowing the monitoring of Page for nearly a year. The president also ordered the release of unredacted text messages from fired FBI Special Agent Peter Strzok, former FBI counsel Lisa Page, former FBI Director James Comey and former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe. The president for months has blasted Strzok and Page for the bias revealed in their text messages, as well as Comey and McCabe for their leadership of the FBI. Comey was fired from the bureau in May 2017; McCabe was fired by Attorney General Jeff Sessions in March; Page left the bureau in May; and Strzok was fired last month. A source familiar with the timing of the declassification told Fox News they expected the Carter Page warrant application to be declassified first, followed by the FBI reports on agent interviews with Ohr. The source added that the Justice Department is working on a \"compressed timeline\" and they expect the first release of records in days or sooner. The text messages are expected to take longer because of the sheer number involved and the fact that Trump ordered their release without redactions. Republicans on Capitol Hill, including House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., are touting the president\u2019s order, saying it covers \u201cpretty much everything that he wanted\u2026and the text messages are a bonus,\u201d a source said of Nunes. Congressional Republicans are hoping the files reveal details about the start of the Russia investigation led by the FBI, which evolved into Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling and potential collusion with Trump campaign associates during the 2016 presidential election. But Democrats,including the committee\u2019s ranking member, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., are blasting the declassification order as a \u201cclear abuse of power.\u201d \"[Trump] has decided to intervene in a pending law enforcement investigation by ordering the selective release of materials he believes are helpful to his defense team and thinks will advance a false narrative,\" Schiff said. \"With respect to some of these materials, I have been previously informed by the FBI and Justice Department that they would consider their release a red line that must not be crossed as they may compromise sources and methods. \"This is evidently of no consequence to a President who cares about nothing about the country and everything about his narrow self-interest,\" Schiff added. The president\u2019s order is similar to his February move, when he cleared the way for the Republican-led House Intelligence Committee to release a partisan memo about the surveillance warrant on Carter Page. Democrats, weeks later, released their own version of the memo.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

Under her lead the paper took a new direction. While it earlier made attempts to balance its shoddier side with some interesting reporting, it is now solidly main stream in the worst sense. It promotes neo-liberalism and a delves into cranky identity grievances stories. It also became an main outlet for manipulative propaganda peddled by the British secret services. Its recent fake news story about Paul Manafort, Wikileaks and Julian Assange aptly demonstrates this. The documentation of it is a bit lengthy but provides that it was a willful fake. On November 27 the Guardian prepared to publish a story which asserted that Paula Manafort, Trump's former campaign manager, had met Julian Assange, the publisher of Wikileaks, in the Ecuadorian embassy in London on at least three occasions. Some two hours before the story went public it contacted Manafort and Assange's lawyers to get their comments. Assange's Wikileaks responded through its public Twitter account which has 5.4 million followers. On of those followers is Katherine Viner: WikiLeaks @wikileaks - 13:06 utc - 27 Nov 2018 SCOOP: In letter today to Assange's lawyers, Guardian's Luke Harding, winner of Private Eye's Plagiarist of the Year, falsely claims jailed former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort had secret meetings with Assange in 2013, 2015 and 2016 in story Guardian are \"planning to run\". It attached the email the Guardian's Luke Harding had send. 90 minutes later the Guardian piece went life. It led the front page and also appeared in print. The first version read: Manafort held secret talks with Assange in Ecuadorian embassy Donald Trump\u2019s former campaign manager Paul Manafort held secret talks with Julian Assange inside the Ecuadorian embassy in London, and visited around the time he joined Trump\u2019s campaign, the Guardian has been told. Sources have said Manafort went to see Assange in 2013, 2015 and in spring 2016 \u2013 during the period when he was made a key figure in Trump\u2019s push for the White House. It is unclear why Manafort wanted to see Assange and what was discussed. But the last meeting is likely to come under scrutiny and could interest Robert Mueller, the special prosecutor who is investigating alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. A well-placed source has told the Guardian that Manafort went to see Assange around March 2016. Months later WikiLeaks released a stash of Democratic emails stolen by Russian intelligence officers. Manafort, 69, denies involvement in the hack and says the claim is \u201c100% false\u201d. His lawyers declined to answer the Guardian\u2019s questions about the visits. The piece did not include the public denial Wikileaks issued to its 5.4 million followers one and a half hour before it was published. The Guardian piece came at a critical moment. Currently the U.K. and Ecuador conspire to deliver Julian Assange to U.S. authorities. On Monday special counsel Robert Mueller said Manafort lied to investigators, violating his recent plea deal. The new sensational claim was immediately picked up by prominent reporters and major main stream outlets. They distributed is as a factual account. It is likely that millions of people took note of its claim. But several people who had followed the Russiagate fairytale and the Mueller investigation were immediately suspicious of the Guardian claim. The story was weakly sourced and included some details that seemed unlikely to be true. Glenn Greenwald noted that the Ecuadorian embassy is under heavy CCTV surveillance. There are several guards, and visitors have to provide their identity to enter it. Every visit is logged. If Manafort had really visited Assange, it would have long been known: In sum, the Guardian published a story today that it knew would explode into all sorts of viral benefits for the paper and its reporters even though there are gaping holes and highly sketchy aspects to the story. Moreover, the main author of the story, Luke Harding, is known to be a notorious fraud, a russo-phobe intelligence asset with a personal grievance towards Assange and Wikileaks. A year ago an important Moon of Alabama piece - From Snowden To Russia-gate - The CIA And The Media - mentioned Harding: The people who promote the \"Russian influence\" nonsense are political operatives or hacks. Take for example Luke Harding of the Guardian who just published a book titled Collusion: Secret Meetings, Dirty Money, and How Russia Helped Donald Trump Win. He was taken apart in a Real News interview (vid) about the book. The interviewer pointed out that there is absolutely no evidence in the book to support its claims. When asked for any proof for his assertion Harding defensively says that he is just \"storytelling\" - in other words: it is fiction. Harding earlier wrote a book about Edward Snowden which was a similar sham. Julian Assange called it \"a hack job in the purest sense of the term\". Harding is also known as plagiarizer. When he worked in Moscow he copied stories and passages from the now defunct Exile, run by Matt Taibbi and Mark Ames. The Guardian had to publish an apology. The new Guardian story looked like another weak attempt to connect the alleged Russian malfeasance with Assange and the Wikileaks publishing of the DNC emails. Assange and other involved people deny that such a relation existed. There is no public evidence that support such claims. Shortly after the Guardian's fake news story went public Paul Manafort issued an unequivocal denial: \u201cI have never met Julian Assange or anyone connected to him,\u201d the statement said. \u201cI have never been contacted by anyone connected to Wikileaks, either directly or indirectly. I have never reached out to Assange or Wikileaks on any matter. We are considering all legal options against the Guardian who proceeded\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

            "question": "Which of the following tactics is used in the following text?\n\nArticle: Apparently, They Think We are Fools As Pope Francis continues his five-year-long tirade against the imaginary Catholic Pharisees who defend the Church\u2019s teaching on the indissolubility of marriage and the integrally related Eucharistic discipline\u2014he is still at it as of yesterday (January 9)\u2014he and his collaborators are busily engineering neo-Pharisaical escape hatches from the negative precepts of the divine and natural law emanating from the Sixth Commandment. Determined to quell any Catholic opposition to his moral subversion, Francis has slapped the label Authentic Magisterium\u00ae on his outrageous opinion that in \u201ccomplex circumstances\u201d wherein it is not \u201cfeasible\u201d to live as brother and sister, two people who are not married can be admitted to Holy Communion without ceasing extra-marital sexual relations so long as they engage in an ill-defined \u201cprocess of discernment.\u201d As Father Brian Harrison has so trenchantly observed, this means that people embroiled in adultery can receive Holy Communion while they \u201cdiscern\u201d that they should not be receiving Holy Communion because they are embroiled in adultery. Do they think we are fools? Then there is the endlessly double-talking Cardinal M\u00fcller. In a recent interview concerning Rocco Buttiglione\u2019s verbal contortions aimed at demonstrating that the administration of Holy Communion to public adulterers is consistent with the Church\u2019s bimillenial prohibition of precisely that, M\u00fcller proposed this preposterous \u201csolution\u201d to a \u201cproblem\u201d that does not exist: It is possible that the penitent may be convinced in conscience, and with good reasons, of the invalidity of the first marriage even though they cannot offer canonical proof. In this case the marriage valid before God would be the second one and the pastor could grant the sacrament, certainly with the appropriate precautions as not to scandalize the community of the faithful and not to weaken the conviction of marriage indissolubility. The Cardinal knows this is moral and canonical nonsense. No Catholic, whether or not he consults a priest, can declare for himself that his marriage in the Church was invalid, especially when\u2014indeed because\u2014he lacks canonical proof of invalidity. Moreover, absent an annulment granted by the competent Church tribunal, a purported \u201csecond marriage\u201d can only be an invalid civil ceremony and thus a thinly disguised form of continuous public adultery. Cardinal Burke, whom Francis sacked as head of the Church\u2019s highest tribunal because he was a major impediment to the conspiracy culminating in Amoris Laetitia (AL), has observed the obvious in this regard: Such cases do not exist. No priest has the authority to declare a marriage null in the internal forum. Marriage is a public state in the Church, and the judgment regarding an accusation of nullity of marriage must be made in accord with the long practice of the Church. If a college of judges in a matrimonial tribunal is not able to arrive at moral certitude regarding the nullity of a marriage after a careful and thorough examination of the petition of nullity, how can an individual priest be capable of making such a judgment having to do with the eternal salvation of the soul in question? The only case in which a priest could admit a person living in an irregular matrimonial union to receive the Sacraments of Penance and Holy Eucharist is the case of a couple who agree to live \u201cas brother and sister\u201d, that is to respect the marriage to which they are bound by not living in a marital way with another person. Even then, the priest would have to insist that the couple living in continence receive the Sacraments in a place in which they are not well known, lest other faithful be led to believe that persons living in an irregular matrimonial union may receive the Sacraments. Does Cardinal M\u00fcller think we are fools? Some of us apparently are, or at least are willing to serve as knowing dupes by defending neo-Pharisaical sophistry that would produce \u201ca discipline alien to the entire Tradition of the Catholic and Apostolic faith.\u201d Apparently, they think they can fool us in the next phase of the program of moral subversion that this incredible Pope seriously expects us to believe is an imperative of \u201cmercy\u201d: the justification of contraception in \u201ccomplex cases\u201d to which \u201cdiscernment\u201d must be applied. Consider the recent declaration by one of Francis\u2019s new appointments to the Pontifical Academy for Life, whose entire membership he sacked and whose constitution he ordered rewritten to neutralize it. In a lecture at the Gregorian, one Father Maurizio Chiodi, a \u201cmoral theologian\u201d of the post-Vatican II variety, proposed that \u201can artificial method for the regulation of births could be recognized as anact of responsibilitythat is carried out, not in order to radically reject the gift of a child, but because in those situationsresponsibility calls the couple and the family to other forms of welcome and hospitality.\u201d That is, Francis\u2019s man at the reconstituted Pontifical Academy declares openly that there is a duty to contracept! Chiodi\u2019s sole \u201cauthority\u201d for this lie from the pit of hell is nothing more than Chapter 8 of AL, the only document of its kind in the entire history of the Church. AL will doubtless be providing cover for a whole new line of Authentic Magisterium\u00ae products, all of which will be utter fakes, including some form of \u201cpastoral integration\u201d of homosexual unions. Evidently, they do think we are fools or willing to play the fool in exchange for the benefits of respectable conformity in the midst of an unparalleled debacle for the Church. (Consider the example of Catholic Answers, which \u201cdefends the Faith\u201d while refusing to recognize that it is under ferocious attack from the very vertices of the Church. Silence at best is the price it must pay for remaining in good standing with the pro-homosexual bishop Francis has installed in San Diego.) But we are not fools. And God will not be mocked. Francis and all his designs will ultimately come to nothing. Meanwhile, ours is but to keep the Faith and protest\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

            "question": "Which of the following tactics is used in the following text?\n\nArticle: Trump Vows to Kick CNN\u2019s Acosta Out Again President Trump took CNN\u2019s improbable court victory temporarily restoring CNN White House correspondent Jim Acosta\u2019s \u201chard pass\u201d media credential for the executive mansion in stride, vowing to kick Acosta out again in the future if he breaches White House protocol again. The yanking of the physical credential, by the way, isn\u2019t exactly a grave hardship. It just means Acosta would need to make an appointment through the White House press office every time he wanted to visit the White House grounds, just as the rest of the non-hard pass-holding journalists who don\u2019t work for big media outlets like CNN have to do. Lacking a hard pass does not prevent anyone from reporting on the White House. Speaking to Chris Wallace of Fox News Channel in an interview that aired Sunday, Trump had some new ideas on how to deal with Acosta, who picks fights with him during pressers. \"I think one of the things we\u2019ll do is maybe turn the camera off that faces them, because then they don\u2019t have any air time, although I\u2019ll probably be sued for that and maybe, you know, win or lose it, who knows,\" Trump said. \"I mean, with this stuff you never know what\u2019s going to happen.\" The president described Acosta as \"unbelievably rude to [White House Press Secretary] Sarah Huckabee, who\u2019s a wonderful woman,\" and said his administration is drawing up \"rules and regulations\" for White House reporters. \"And if he misbehaves, we\u2019ll throw him out or we\u2019ll stop the news conference,\" Trump said. Acosta\u2019s hard pass was pulled after a contentious Nov. 7 press conference at the White House. After interacting with President Trump \u2013 Acosta said he wanted to \u201cchallenge\u201d him on calling the Central American caravans an \u201cinvasion\u201d \u2013 the president called upon another reporter to speak. After lecturing Trump, Acosta belligerently refused to yield the microphone to a White House staffer and pushed her arm away as she reached for the device, all of which was captured on video. On Nov. 16, U.S. District Judge Timothy J. Kelly of Washington, D.C., who was appointed by Trump, ruled against the administration and ordered Acosta\u2019s hard pass restored for 14 days, pending further hearings in the lawsuit. But it was not a vindication of Acosta\u2019s free speech rights under the First Amendment. The judge specifically said that the First Amendment claim made by Acosta and CNN had not yet been adjudicated and added that the president was free not to call on Acosta at future press conferences. The temporary restraining order was nowhere to be found online at press time, but according to media reports, Kelly found that the administration violated Acosta\u2019s due process rights under the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution. The White House vowed to remedy the situation by drawing up rules governing press conferences. The U.S. Department of Justice said the court ruling was disappointing. \u201cThe President has broad authority to regulate access to the White House, including to ensure fair and orderly White House events and press conferences. We look forward to continuing to defend the White House's lawful actions.\" Acosta ignorantly blathered on to reporters when he returned to the White House Friday after the court ruling, incorrectly claiming he won a great First Amendment victory. \"I'm very grateful for what happened today,\" Acosta said. \"I'm grateful for my colleagues in the press who stood by us through all of this.\" \"This was a test and I think we passed the test,\" he said. \"Journalists need to know that in this country their First Amendment rights of freedom of the press are sacred, they're protected in our Constitution,\" Acosta said. \"Throughout all of this I was confident and I thought that this would be the result at the end of the day that our rights would be protected as we continue to cover our government and hold our leaders accountable.\" The court case isn\u2019t over yet. The legal antagonists have to report to the court Monday afternoon. The court ordered the parties to \u201cfile a joint status report proposing how they would like to proceed in this case by 3:00 p.m. on November 19, 2018[,]\u201d according to its online docket. According to CNN, \u201cWhite House officials sent Acosta a letter stating that his pass is set to be suspended again once the restraining order expires.\u201d From the looks of the letter, the W.H. is trying to establish a paper trail that will empower the administration to boot Acosta again at the end of the month. CNN responded with this statement on Sunday: \"The White House is continuing to violate the First and 5th Amendments of the Constitution. These actions threaten all journalists and news organizations. Jim Acosta and CNN will continue to report the news about the White House and the President.\" The Acosta-CNN lawsuit was filed by Ted Boutrous and Trump-hating Republican lawyer Ted Olson, of the law firm Gibson, Dunn, and Crutcher. Olson was solicitor general in President George W. Bush\u2019s administration. (The legal complaint may be viewed here.) Boutrous said CNN is prepared to dig in for a protracted legal fight if it needs to. \"We're ready to litigate as long as we have to, to protect these First Amendment rights, to ask the court to declare rules of the road going forward,\" he said.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

Wait, were the same guys in the autopsy room that were there when the doctors and coroners examined John F Kennedy ? \u201cI don\u2019t believe this is consistent with what the court ordered,\u201d said Las Vegas attorney Maggie McLetchie, who represents the Las Vegas Review-Journal and The Associated Press in their November action demanding the release of the reports. \u201cThey (the coroner\u2019s office) have delayed this for too long, and whatever stage the coroner\u2019s report on Paddock is in, it should be provided to the Review-Journal and Associated Press without further delay. No more games. Release the records.\u201d \u201cThe court correctly recognized the presumption of public access to records, even when a mass tragedy occurs,\u201d McLetchie added. \u201c(The judge) also rejected arguments by the coroner\u2019s office that there were any privacy interests with regards to the autopsy of Stephen Paddock, let alone any that outweighed the strong presumption of access to records in Nevada.\u201d \u201cThe shooter\u2019s body was cremated Dec. 21,\" said Review-Journal Editor-in-Chief Keith Moyer added. \"How can the autopsy report not be \u2018finalized\u2019 when the body was cremated more than five weeks ago? The law is squarely on the side of the public\u2019s right to open government.\u201d That's exactly right! Something is rotten in Denmark! On top of that, we have questions as to whether the body was even that of Stephen Paddock, given the fact that certain elements of the Paddock in the preliminary police report, which mentioned the autopsy, are apparently at odds with the Paddock of other documentation. McLetchie has been trying to obtain as much information for the public as possible, including video of Paddock at the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino. However, she has been told by Las Vegas Metro Police Department attornies that they can't release that information until they finalize their investigation into other suspects which may also produce charges in the case. \u201cThe coroner\u2019s office has fought to keep autopsy reports confidential,\u201d the Review-Journal. The coroner was ordered on January 11 to pay nearly $32,000 in legal costs to the Review-Journal because it refused to release public records. While the preliminary report indicated the Paddock died of a gun shot wound to the head through the mouth, it's all the details that aren't given that seem to be problematic for the coroner to release. By the way, the toxicology report was not mentioned in the preliminary report. Article posted with permission from Sons Of Liberty Media\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

            "question": "Which of the following tactics is used in the following text?\n\nArticle: US embassy worker in China suffers 'brain injury' amid 'sonic attack' fears A US embassy worker in China has reported experiencing \"abnormal sensations of sounds and pressure\" amid fears of a \"sonic attack\". The state department has issued a health alert to its citizens in the country, adding that the unnamed staff member's symptoms indicate a \"mild traumatic brain injury\". The findings echo similar reports that caused the US to recall non-essential embassy staff from Cuba in 2017, after at least 24 US citizens suffered symptoms indicating they had been deliberately and covertly targeted. US investigators are looking into whether the employee in China has been affected by a \"sonic attack\", which was one of the theories behind the still-unexplained illnesses suffered in Havana. The unnamed government worker was based in the southeast port city of Guangzhou, where an American consulate is based. He has now been flown back to the US for assessment, according to reports. The state department has issued a health alert to its staff in China, which states: \"While in China, if you experience any unusual acute auditory or sensory phenomena accompanied by unusual sounds or piercing noises, do not attempt to locate their source. \"Instead, move to a location where the sounds are not present.\" Image: US secretary of state Mike Pompeo is set to meet with Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi on Wednesday The embassy in Beijing said it could not link the case in China to the health issues suffered by its staff in Cuba. In an email to citizens in China, the state department said: \"A US government employee in China recently reported subtle and vague, but abnormal, sensations of sound and pressure. \"The US government is taking these reports seriously and has informed its official staff in China of this event.\" They added that they are not sure what has caused the employee's symptoms. The US Secretary of Mike Pompeo has said he is concerned about the \"serious health incident\" that has affected an embassy worker in Guangzhou. China's foreign ministry and national health commission did not immediately respond to questions about the findings, the Associated Press reported. The US reduced its workforce in Havana, Cuba, in 2017 after its personnel and their families reported experiencing a range of health issues. Investigators have drawn theories including that were targeted by sonic attacks, where the symptoms included dizziness, headaches and vomiting. The attacks can sometimes be carried out by emitting \"infrasounds\", which are low frequency noises that can affect human hearing if they are loud enough. However, Dr Toby Heys told the New Scientist in 2017 that an infrasound attack wouldn't be \"very covert\" as a \"large array of subwoofers\" would be needed. Image: The US recalled non-essential embassy staff from Havana, Cuba, after potential sonic attacks in 2017 The other type is an \"ultrasound\" attack, whereby a high frequency noise inaudible to human ears can be targeted easily at potential victims. They can damage parts of the ear such as hairs that pick up sounds, but again it is reported that large equipment would be needed for such an attack. Other theories behind the health issues in Cuba include the use of electromagnetic weapons, which can target highly-focused energy at potential victims. This can include a laser, microwaves, or particle beams. Investigators also speculated that a flawed spy device could be behind the victims' ailments in Cuba. The US expelled 15 Cuban diplomats from the US after the alleged acoustic attacks. Secretary of state Mike Pompeo met with Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi in Washington on Wednesday. They were expected to discuss a planned meeting between President Donald Trump and the North Korea leader Kim Jong-Un, but concerns about the incident in Guangzhou are likely to have been raised. China and the US are considered strategic rivals for influence in Asia, but conduct hundreds of billions of dollars of annual trade with each other.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

Buchanan: Boehner's Right\u2014It's Trump's Party Now | Articles See, earlier Trump Victorious As GOP Transformed Into A National Conservative Party by James Kirkpatrick, May 3, 2016 \"There is no Republican Party. There's a Trump party,\" John Boehner told a Mackinac, Michigan, gathering of the GOP faithful last week. \"The Republican Party is kind of taking a nap somewhere.\" Ex-Speaker Boehner should probably re-check the old party's pulse, for the Bush-Boehner GOP may not just be napping. It could be comatose. Consider. That GOP was dedicated to free trade, open borders, amnesty and using U.S. power to punish aggressors and \"end tyranny in our world.\" That GOP set out to create a new world order where dictatorships were threatened with \"regime change,\" and democratic capitalism was the new order of the ages. Yet, Donald Trump captured the Republican nomination and won the presidency\u2014by saying goodbye to all that. How probable is it that a future GOP presidential candidate will revive the Bush-Boehner agenda the party rejected in 2016, run on it, win, and impose it on the party and nation? Bush-Boehner Republicanism appears to be as dead today as was Harding-Coolidge Republicanism after 1933. And if Trumpism is not the future of the GOP, it is hard to see what a promising GOP agenda might look like. A brief history: In seven elections starting in 1992, Republicans won the presidency three times, but the popular vote only once, in 2004, when George W. was still basking in his \"Mission Accomplished\" in Iraq. What fractured and overwhelmed the Bush-Boehner Republican Party? First, demography. The mass immigration of Third World peoples that began with the 1965 immigration act, and the decline in the birth rate of native-born Americans, began to swamp the Nixon-Reagan New Majority. Second, the collapse of the Soviet Empire and USSR removed the party's great unifying cause from Eisenhower to Bush I\u2014the Cold War. After the Red Army went home, \"America First\" had a new appeal! Third, faithful to the free trade cult in which they were raised, Republicans championed NAFTA, the WTO, and MFN for China. Historians will look back in amazement at how America's free trade zealots gave away the greatest manufacturing base the world had ever seen, as they quoted approvingly 18th- and 19th-century scribblers whose ideas had done so much to bring down their own country, Great Britain. Between 1997 and 2017, the EU ran up, at America's expense, trade surpluses in goods in excess of $2 trillion, while we also picked up the bill for Europe's defense. Between 1992 and 2016, China was allowed to run $4 trillion in trade surpluses at our expense, converting herself into the world's first manufacturing power and denuding America of tens of thousands of factories and millions of manufacturing jobs. In Trump's first year, China's trade surplus with the United States hit $375 billion. From January to March of this year, our trade deficit with China was running at close to the same astronomical rate. \"Trade deficits do not matter,\" we hear from the economists. They might explain that to Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania. And perhaps someone can explain the wisdom of handing 4 percent of our GDP each year to an adversary nation, as U.S. admirals talk tough about confronting that adversary nation over islets and reefs in the South China Sea. Why are we enriching and empowering so exorbitantly those whom we are told we may have to fight? Fourth, under Bush II and Obama, the U.S. intervened massively in the Near and Middle East\u2014in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Yemen. And the forces that pushed up into those conflicts, and so disillusioned the nation that it elected Barack Obama, are back, pushing for a new war, on Iran. They may get this war, too. Yet, given the anti-interventionist and anti-war stance of Trump's winning campaign, and of the Bernie Sanders campaign, U.S. involvement in Middle East wars seems less America's future than it does her past. After his 16 months in office, it appears as though the Trump presidency, no matter how brief, is going to be a watershed moment in U.S. and world history, and in the future of the GOP. The world is changing. NATO and the EU are showing their age. Nationalism, populism and tribalism are pervasive on the Old Continent. And America's willingness to bear the burden of Europe's defense, as they ride virtually free, is visibly waning. It is hard to see why or how Republicans are ever again going to be the Bush-Boehner party that preceded the rise of Trump. What would be the argument for returning to a repudiated platform? Trump not only defeated 16 Bush Republicans, he presented an agenda on immigration, border security, amnesty, intervention abroad, the Middle East, NAFTA, free trade, Putin and Russia that was a rejection of what the Bush-Boehner Party had stood for and what its presidential candidates in 2008 and 2012, John McCain and Mitt Romney, had run on. If the Republican Party is \"napping,\" let it slumber on, undisturbed, for its time has come and gone. We are in a new world now. COPYRIGHT 2018 CREATORS.COM Patrick J.

Just so we're all clear. Shutterstock A professor at Southern New Hampshire University failed one of her student's assignments because the professor incorrectly thought Australia \"is not a country,\" according to a report in BuzzFeed News. Australia is, in fact, a country. The student, Ashley Arnold, is working towards an online sociology degree with the university. For one of her final assignments, she had to compare a social norm in the United States to another country. She chose to compare social media use in the US to what it's like in Australia. The professor, according to BuzzFeed News, failed Arnolds because \"Australia is a continent; not a country,\" which, again, is incorrect, just so we're clear here. Australia is both a continent and a country. When Arnold complained, the professor said they'd reexamine the assignment, but did not concede that Australia was a country. \"Australia is a continent; it is not a country. That error made it nearly impossible for you to accurately complete your week 2 research outline correctly,\" the professor wrote in an email obtained by BuzzFeed News. \"As I mentioned above I will look over your week two paper once again and see if you earned more credits than I gave you.\" In another email exchange, Arnold correctly asserted that Australia is a country, linking to the \"About Australia\" section of the country's website: Australia is both a country and a continent. It's the only country that is both. I provided a resource in the first email that clarifies that for you. If you need further clarification google or the SNHU Shapiro Library has that information you. Again I mean no disrespect but my grade is affected by your assumption that Australia is not a country when it in fact is. Thank you and let me know if I need to provide further resources proving Australia is a country. The professor said they'd take Arnold's concerns into consideration. \"Thank you for this web-address,\" they wrote. \"After I do some independent research on the continent/country issue I will review your paper.\" After a period of review, the professor changed Arnold's grade to a B+, according to BuzzFeed News. The professor did not acknowledge their error. A representative for Southern New Hampshire University didn't immediately respond to INSIDER's request for comment. In a tweet, it said it refunded Arnold's tuition for the class and \"replaced the instructor.\" Sign up here to get INSIDER's favorite stories straight to your inbox.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

Noah Lew and two other students were voted off the Students\u2019 Society of McGill University last October after they were identified as having pro-Israel viewpoints. They were since reinstated. A report made public this week by Spencer Boudreau concluded he could not determine if students who organized against the three board members had anti-Semitic intentions. Boudreau, a retired professor of education and former ombudsperson for students, however, said he understood why the students felt they were targeted because they are Jewish. After criticism from several Jewish groups both on and off campus, Boudreau issued a clarification to the report, saying he could not determine if the vote was motivated by anti-Semitism, but he acknowledged there were \u201cin fact anti-Semitic effects felt by members of the Jewish community.\u201d Speaking to the Montreal Gazette on Friday, Lew, the SSMU\u2019s vice-president of finance for the Arts, said he was initially upset with the report, but felt vindicated by Boudreau\u2019s clarification. \u201cI thought this acknowledgement was very important and I really did appreciate that he clarified the matter,\u201d he said. Jewish groups had criticized Boudreau\u2019s report, saying it ignored anti-Semitic language used on Facebook by a group called Democratize SSMU. The group was urging students to vote against Lew, and two other board members who were deemed to be pro-Israel, alleging \u201clayers of corruption\u201d within the student government and favouritism in appointing board members, then singled out three members of the board \u201cwho are all either fellows at the Canadian Jewish Political Affairs Committee, an organization whose explicit mandate is to promote pro-Israel discourse in Canadian politics, or primary organizers for the anti-BDS initiative at McGill.\u201d Boudreau made his clarification after it was pointed out the anti-Semitic language was published prior to the vote. While Democratize SSMU later apologized for the language and deleted it from its site, the damage had already been done, Boudreau concluded. Lew said he feels vindicated to some extent, but is concerned anti-Semitism is still a problem within student government. \u201cThere have been some steps taken by the administration and the student body in the right direction, but it\u2019s certainly not over,\u201d he said. In the months leading up to the vote, there had been other anti-Semitic incidents, including a tweet by Igor Sadikov, an elected representative of students in McGill\u2019s faculty of arts, saying: \u201cpunch a zionist.\u201d Among the measures taken by SSMU after the October vote was the creation of a committee looking into the issue of anti-Semitism within the student government, which Lew sits on. On Wednesday, McGill Principal Suzanne Fortier said the University wants to ensure a safe space for all students. \u201cI would like to take this opportunity to make it clear that there is absolutely no place for anti-Semitism at McGill University and that, as principal and vice-chancellor, I will remain vigilant to ensure that all members of our community feel safe, welcomed and respected on our campuses.\u201d In addition to ordering the report, Fortier set up a hotline to report incidents of of intolerance and a task force to investigate incidents of academic freedom and equity. Rabbi Reuben Poupko, the co-chair for Quebec of the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, said it should be noted McGill in general is a safe space for Jewish students. However, he said any Jewish students thinking of being involved in student politics or activism \u201cwill have encounters that are profoundly disturbing and unpleasant.\u201d He said McGill is not alone in this respect, as this is a continent-wide phenomenon within student politics. Democratize SSMU did not respond to a request for an interview.

Thank you! For decades, Americans have known that very sick things happen behind the scenes in Washington D.C., but the mainstream media nearly really talks about any of it. But now the curtain is starting to be pulled back, and the revelations about Al Franken are just the beginning. Earlier this week, I wrote an article about how \u201csexual harassment is rampant in the halls of Congress\u201d, and that was before a female radio anchor named LeeAnn Tweeden revealed that Al Franken had \u201cforcibly kissed\u201d and groped her during a USO tour in 2006. The following comes from an article in which Tweeden shared her story\u2026 I couldn\u2019t believe it. He groped me, without my consent, while I was asleep. I felt violated all over again. Embarrassed. Belittled. Humiliated. How dare anyone grab my breasts like this and think it\u2019s funny? I told my husband everything that happened and showed him the picture. I wanted to shout my story to the world with a megaphone to anyone who would listen, but even as angry as I was, I was worried about the potential backlash and damage going public might have on my career as a broadcaster. But that was then, this is now. I\u2019m no longer afraid. When the story initially broke, Franken rushed to issue an apology\u2026 \u201cI certainly don\u2019t remember the rehearsal for the skit in the same way, but I send my sincerest apologies to Leeann,\u201d said Franken. \u201cAs to the photo, it was clearly intended to be funny but wasn\u2019t. I shouldn\u2019t have done it.\u201d Needless to say, many were completely unsatisfied with Franken\u2019s very weak statement. In fact, some members of his own party said that his apology was entirely insufficient and are calling for Franken to be held accountable for his actions\u2026 Guy Cecil, the former head of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and now the boss of a leading Democratic super PAC, voiced his frustration with the inadequacy of Franken\u2019s apology on Twitter. \u201cThat was not an apology and was an insufficient response to serious allegations,\u201d Cecil tweeted. \u201cAl Franken must be held accountable if our party wants to live up to our commitment to women & girls.\u201d This scandal has set off a feeding frenzy as Internet sleuths search for other incidents in which Franken has acted inappropriately. And of course, since we are talking about Al Franken, it wasn\u2019t exactly difficult to find material. For example, a photo has surfaced of Franken grabbing Joy Behar in a very creepy manner. The following comes from Breitbart\u2026 Amid the emergence of a 2006 photo of Al Franken groping journalist and talk radio anchor Leeann Tweeden, a photo of the embattled Minnesota Senator appearing to grab comedian Joy Behar\u2019s breast has also resurfaced. Franken was a comedian before he ever entered the world of politics, and we understand that. But just because he was a comedian does not mean that he gets to play by a different set of rules. There appears to be an ongoing pattern of behavior, and Fox News has documented some of the other incidents that have come up in the past\u2026 Franken, then a comedian, was quoted in a 1995 New York Magazine article discussing a skit for \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d that involved drugging and raping CBS reporter Lesley Stahl. Franken, at the time a writer for \u201cSNL,\u201d suggested one skit should play out with \u201c60 Minutes\u201d commentator Andy Rooney finding an empty pill bottle on his desk. \u201c\u2019I give the pills to Lesley Stahl. Then when Lesley is passed out, I take her to the closet and rape her.\u2019 Or \u2018That\u2019s why you never see Lesley until February.\u2019 Or, \u2018When she passes out. I put her in various positions and take pictures of her,\u2019\u201d Franken was quoted saying. The article, along with a 2000 Playboy column in which Franken talked about fantasizing a machine would perform oral sex on him, was used to attack Franken during his 2008 Senate campaign in Minnesota. As much as we may be appalled by some of the things that Al Franken has done, the truth is that there are far worse offenders in Washington. Let\u2019s talk about Bill Clinton for a moment. Democrats have been covering up his sexual crimes for years, and my hope is that now this will start to change. Juanita Broaddrick, Kathleen Willey, Connie Hamzy, Eileen Wellstone, Sandra Allen James, Christy Zercher, Paula Jones, Monica Lewinsky, Gennifer Flowers, Elizabeth Ward Gracen, Sally Perdue, Lencola Sullivan, Susie Whitacre and Bobbie Ann William are some of the women that have made allegations against Clinton, and if even half of their allegations are true Clinton should be in prison for the rest of his life. In my article yesterday, I discussed how one Secret Service agent is charging former Vice-President Joe Biden of engaging in \u201cWeinstein-level\u201d behavior, and I also talked about how 15 million dollars in settlements have been secretly paid out to victims of sexual harassment in the House of Representatives in recent years. There is a culture of corruption in Washington D.C., and we desperately need to drain the swamp. If you agree, I hope that you will support my campaign and the campaigns of other anti-establishment candidates that want to clean up the halls of Congress. It is time to take our government back because at this point it has become an absolutely disgusting cesspool of filth and corruption.

            "question": "Which of the following tactics is used in the following text?\n\nArticle: Kate Steinle's death at the hands of a Mexican national became a flashpoint in the immigration debate \u2014 here's the story behind her killing The surprise acquittal of Jose Ines Garcia Zarate in the shooting death of San Francisco woman Kate Steinle set off a firestorm of outrage Thursday night, as top conservatives and critics of so-called \"sanctuary cities\" pinned blame for Steinle's death on illegal immigration and insufficiently aggressive deportation policies. Garcia Zarate, a 45-year-old Mexican national who was homeless and living in the US illegally when he fired the shot that killed Steinle, was acquitted by a jury on murder and manslaughter charges. The jury convicted him of the lesser charge of being a felon in possession of a gun, which carries a maximum sentence of three years in state prison. Steinle, 32, was fatally shot while she walked along Pier 14 of the San Francisco Bay with her father in July 2015. The bullet that pierced her back had ricocheted off the concrete ground after it was fired by Garcia Zarate from a handgun belonging to a federal ranger that had been stolen four days earlier. Garcia Zarate's defense attorneys argued that the shooting was an accident \u2014 they said he found the gun wrapped in a T-shirt or cloth under a pier bench and unintentionally discharged it. Lead attorney Matt Gonzalez has argued that the weapon was a SIG Sauer with a \"hair trigger in single-action mode\" \u2014 a model well-known for accidental discharges even among experienced shooters. Gonzalez told the jury, according to the San Francisco Chronicle, that Garcia Zarate had never handled a firearm before, was frightened by the noise of the gunshot, then flung the weapon into the bay where it was later found by a diver. Prosecutors, however, alleged that Garcia Zarate brought the weapon to the pier deliberately to do harm, and intentionally aimed and shot Steinle after firmly pulling the trigger. They said Garcia Zarate then threw the weapon into the bay and fled the scene. Beyond the shooting itself, perhaps the most controversial aspect of Garcia Zarate's case involves his previous criminal activity and history of deportations, and how San Francisco and federal authorities handled his custody before he ever picked up the gun and shot Steinle. At the time of Steinle's death, Garcia Zarate had been convicted of nonviolent drug crimes and deported five times since the early 1990s. He faced a sixth deportation in 2015, and was in Justice Department (DOJ) custody that March after serving 46 months in prison for a felony re-entry into the US, but instead of transferring him into the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for deportation, the department transferred him to the San Francisco County Jail for prosecution of a 1995 marijuana charge. San Francisco prosecutors, who had long ago deprioritized marijuana charges, dismissed the decades-old charge and released Garcia Zarate on April 15, 2015. Due to San Francisco's policy of limiting cooperation with federal immigration authorities \u2014 which some refer to as a \"sanctuary\" policy \u2014 the city did not inform ICE when they released Garcia Zarate. As a result of the case, both the DOJ and the city of San Francisco have changed several policies. The DOJ announced in 2016 it would no longer release potentially deportable detainees to local jails without first allowing ICE to take custody. San Francisco, meanwhile, has adjusted its policy to notify ICE if they are releasing suspected undocumented immigrants who face charges of serious or violent felonies. \"This tragedy could have been prevented if San Francisco had simply turned the alien over to ICE as we requested, instead of releasing him back onto the streets,\" ICE Director Thomas Homan said in a statement on Thursday. \"It is unconscionable that politicians across this country continue to endanger the lives of Americans with sanctuary policies while ignoring the harm inflicted on their constituents.\" But ICE has faced criticism of its own over not seeking a judicial warrant to legally obtain custody of Garcia Zarate when it discovered he had been transferred into San Francisco's custody. The agency has argued that obtaining judicial warrants are unnecessary and would place too much burden on ICE officials and federal courts. Though the agency did issue a request to the city to detain Garcia Zarate until ICE officials could pick him up, their detainer requests are not signed by a judge and are therefore not legally binding. San Francisco's policy is to ignore such requests if they are not accompanied by judge-signed warrants, and the city has cited federal court cases concluding that such detentions violate inmates' Fourth Amendment rights. Garcia Zarate's deportation and criminal history made him an effective target for immigration hardliners, who argued that Steinle would still be alive were it not for an insecure border and lenient treatment toward suspected undocumented immigrants in local jails. President Donald Trump immediately seized on the verdict on Thursday as evidence of the perils of \"Illegal Immigration.\" Trump frequently villainized Garcia Zarate and cited Steinle's death during his presidential campaign, using the case to bolster his argument for a border wall and aid his crusade against \"sanctuary cities.\" Early on Friday, Trump also falsely claimed on Twitter that Garcia Zarate had previously committed violent crimes and had illegally entered the US six times due to lax border security under the Obama administration. \"The Kate Steinle killer came back and back over the weakly protected Obama border, always committing crimes and being violent, and yet this info was not used in court. His exoneration is a complete travesty of justice. BUILD THE WALL!\" Trump tweeted. In fact, Garcia Zarate had never been convicted of a violent crime before Steinle's shooting \u2014 his previous convictions were for nonviolent drug crimes and illegal entry. Lax border security, too, does not appear to be a factor since Garcia Zarate was caught by border patrol agents each time he entered the country\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

Right about now the people in the Clinton camp should be getting very nervous about the ongoing investigations into the Uranium One deal. What must be most annoying for the Clinton team is that these investigations all started as a way to undermine the Trump administration and continue to push connections between Trump and Russia. Now, more than a year after the investigations began, it\u2019s looking less likely than ever that President Trump did anything wrong\u2026 but the investigations seem to be zeroing in on key Clinton team members (including the Clintons themselves). On Tuesday night Fox News Sean Hannity sat down to talk about the exploding scandal that is the Uranium One deal, and what it could mean for the Clinton family. Hannity spoke with investigative reporter Sara Carter of Circa, John Solomon of The Hill, and Victoria Toensing, an attorney representing the FBI informant who allegedly possesses documents on the sale of Canadian mining company \u2018Uranium One\u2019 to Russia interests back in 2010. Now that the NDA (non disclosure agreement) has been lifted Circa\u2019s Sara Carter is \u201creporting that she has received a treasure trove of documents that in fact prove tonight the FBI informant has knowledge of Russia\u2019s involvement in uranium one.\u201d Not to be outdone, the Hill\u2019s John Solomon had found even more dirt on this ugly Clinton led deal. Apparently, Solomon has learned that the FBI informant \u201chas evidence, was on the inside, directly from Putin\u2019s Russia, the push for nuclear fuel deals, and all the crimes we talked about, bribery, kickback, extortion, money laundering, racketeering, all knelt corroborating and will be corroborated even further. Go into your report.\u201d This is all about to get very ugly. https://youtu.be/_DFeri21hlc HANNITY: Breaking news tonight, the Hills John Solomon, investigative reporter Sara Carter, they released bombshell reports equally tonight. Solomon reporting according to the memos obtained, the FBI informant that now has had his NDA lifted at the center of this case gathered years and years of evidence of Russia\u2019s plot to control U.S. Nuclear fuel, which included the uranium one deal. And Sara Carter reporting that she has received a treasure trove of documents that in fact prove tonight the FBI informant has knowledge of Russia\u2019s involvement in uranium one. Also joining us now is the attorney for the FBI informant, Victoria Toensing along with John and Sara. Sara, let\u2019s start with your report. A treasure trove, that is huge. SARAH CARTER, CIRCA NEWS: It is Sean. I mean there\u2019s over 5,000 documents which include emails, briefs, other documentation, memorandums that the informant had turned over to the FBI and Justice Department, and within these documents, it\u2019s very evident of Russia\u2019s intention to enter the American market, energy market. And their intentions to acquire uranium one. HANNITY: John, you go into extensive detail in a very long and hard-hitting piece tonight and revealing piece, how the FBI informant \u2014 you actually said six years, I thought he was only an informant for four years. He has evidence, was on the inside, directly from Putin\u2019s Russia, the push for nuclear fuel deals, and all the crimes we talked about, bribery, kickback, extortion, money laundering, racketeering, all knelt corroborating and will be corroborated even further. Go into your report. JOHN SOLOMON, THE HILL: You know, Sara just said something about the importance of the dominance of the uranium market. This is an email that the FBI has had for six years. It shows that uranium one was part of a Russia strategy to control, not just benefit from the global market, controlled the global market. That would put the United States at a disadvantage. That is the sort of evidence that this FBI informant has right now. If you go back on the last week we heard several things from the Justice Department, there\u2019s no connection to uranium one. These are emails that say uranium one that are in the FBI files. They said that there was no connection between the uranium one case and the criminal case. We now know the criminal case got its first evidence in 2009, a whole year before the uranium one deal was approved by the Obama administration. There are a lot of things that people have been saying that these documents simply don\u2019t agree with. HANNITY: All right. I got a very high ranking Congressman and that knows, let us put it that way, and actually sent me a note. The knowledge of key administration officials will be the next thing proven by both of you, and the links to the Clinton foundation. Sara, is that true? CARTER: I believe that is true. I mean especially when we at \u2014 HANNITY: Do believe or you know? I can\u2019t ask Victoria that question because she won\u2019t tell me. CARTER: I know it\u2019s true. I know that looking at these documents following the money, following the money is what\u2019s important here. The Justice Department has not pointed out that they will possibly call a special counsel to this. This is still out there. They are looking into it. That is something that they need to decide. But whether it\u2019s a special counsel or whether it\u2019s a prosecutor that is investigating this, they will be able to follow the money. There are somethings said \u2026 HANNITY: When you say follow the money, my suspicion would go to the money came directly from Russia, was funneled through the Canadian donors to the Clinton Foundation. How good are my instincts? CARTER: You have pretty good instincts. I think there\u2019s a lot of other areas that they will be looking at as well. Remember this is like peeling back an onion. You peel one part and then you find another part. And that is what\u2019s going to require somebody to do an extensive investigation. HANNITY: But it is beginning to cascade Sara. CARTER: It is.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

Cody finally won against the federal beast after intimidation tactics were performed against him by the Obama Justice Department. The Trump DOJ settled with Wilson, finally acknowledging that his 3D print gun files are protected as free speech under the First Amendment. I first reported that 3-D guns were for real back in July of 2012, when an internet gunsmith by the name of \"Have Blue\" produced an AR style pistol that fired both .22 and .223 caliber bullets. Later, Cody Wilson, 25, a law student at the University of Texas and founder of the non-profit group Defense Distributed, had produced a 3-D printed handgun made entirely of ABS plastic with only a metal firing pin. take our poll - story continues below Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?

In 2013, Wilson had the information on how to build the gun removed from public access at the request of the United States Department of Defense Trade Controls. According to Wilson, they seized control of the information. Clearly, they were acting unlawfully when they did what they did. \"I thought my life was over,\" Wilson said after his attorneys told him he didn't fair well going up against the government. So, what did he do? He fired them, and got a new legal team. Wired has the story. Instead, Wilson has spent the last years on an unlikely project for an anarchist: Not simply defying or skirting the law but taking it to court and changing it. In doing so, he has now not only defeated a legal threat to his own highly controversial gunsmithing project. He may have also unlocked a new era of digital DIY gunmaking that further undermines gun control across the United States and the world\u2014another step toward Wilson's imagined future where anyone can make a deadly weapon at home with no government oversight. Two months ago, the Department of Justice quietly offered Wilson a settlement to end a lawsuit he and a group of co-plaintiffs have pursued since 2015 against the United States government. Wilson and his team of lawyers focused their legal argument on a free speech claim: They pointed out that by forbidding Wilson from posting his 3-D-printable data, the State Department was not only violating his right to bear arms but his right to freely share information. By blurring the line between a gun and a digital file, Wilson had also successfully blurred the lines between the Second Amendment and the First. \"If code is speech, the constitutional contradictions are evident,\" Wilson explained to WIRED when he first launched the lawsuit in 2015. \"So what if this code is a gun?\u201d The Department of Justice's surprising settlement, confirmed in court documents earlier this month, essentially surrenders to that argument. It promises to change the export control rules surrounding any firearm below .50 caliber\u2014with a few exceptions like fully automatic weapons and rare gun designs that use caseless ammunition\u2014and move their regulation to the Commerce Department, which won't try to police technical data about the guns posted on the public internet. In the meantime, it gives Wilson a unique license to publish data about those weapons anywhere he chooses. \"I consider it a truly grand thing,\" Wilson says. \"It will be an irrevocable part of political life that guns are downloadable, and we helped to do that.\" The Second Amendment Foundation has issued the following press release: BELLEVUE, WA \u2013 The Department of Justice and Second Amendment Foundation have reached a settlement in SAF\u2019s lawsuit on behalf of Cody Wilson and Defense Distributed over free speech issues related to 3-D files and other information that may be used to manufacture lawful firearms. SAF and Defense Distributed had filed suit against the State Department under the Obama administration, challenging a May 2013 attempt to control public speech as an export under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), a Cold War-era law intended to control exports of military articles. Under terms of the settlement, the government has agreed to waive its prior restraint against the plaintiffs, allowing them to freely publish the 3-D files and other information at issue. The government has also agreed to pay a significant portion of the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney\u2019s fees, and to return $10,000 in State Department registration dues paid by Defense Distributed as a result of the prior restraint. Significantly, the government expressly acknowledges that non-automatic firearms up to .50-caliber \u2013 including modern semi-auto sporting rifles such as the popular AR-15 and similar firearms \u2013 are not inherently military. \u201cNot only is this a First Amendment victory for free speech, it also is a devastating blow to the gun prohibition lobby,\u201d noted SAF founder and Executive Vice President Alan M. Gottlieb. \u201cFor years, anti-gunners have contended that modern semi-automatic sport-utility rifles are so-called \u2018weapons of war,\u2019 and with this settlement, the government has acknowledged they are nothing of the sort. \u201cUnder this settlement,\u201d he continued, \u201cthe government will draft and pursue regulatory amendments that eliminate ITAR control over the technical information at the center of this case. They will transfer export jurisdiction to the Commerce Department, which does not impose prior restraint on public speech. That will allow Defense Distributed and SAF to publish information about 3-D technology.\u201d The Second Amendment Foundation (www.saf.org)\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

The latter think that removing guns will suddenly force humanity to stop all animosity toward one another, hold hands, and sing Kumbaya. The former recognizes that an armed populace is a threat to any tyrant and pushes for gun control out of self-preservation. However, a new ruling in a court case over 3-D printer files of guns has now made gun control virtually impossible.

In the days after that first test-firing, his gun was downloaded more than 100,000 times. Wilson made the decision to go all in on the project, dropping out of law school at the University of Texas, as if to confirm his belief that technology supersedes law. The law caught up. Less than a week later, Wilson received a letter from the US State Department demanding that he take down his printable-gun blueprints or face prosecution for violating federal export controls. Under an obscure set of US regulations known as the International Trade in Arms Regulations (ITAR), Wilson was accused of exporting weapons without a license, just as if he\u2019d shipped his plastic gun to Mexico rather than put a digital version of it on the internet.

THAT IS WHY the police were there. \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffb pic.twitter.com/ABIvsJNW4d \u2014 Laura Loomer (@LauraLoomer) September 23, 2018 On Saturday, there was an education panel at the Education Minnesota Apple Valley open to union members and guests. Prior to the event, Ellison's campaign called police to ensure that he was \"protected\" from a woman armed with a mic and camera phone . Loomer peppered him with questions about the alleged abuse at a State Attorney General debate Friday night. She stood alongside other female survivors of abuse. Ellison not only claimed the women were lying but then fled the scene. At least he said something there, which is more than I can say for his response earlier in September when Loomer confronted him at another event with questions. Failing to answer, Ellison tried to move from person to person, allowing his minions to try and provide cover for him, similar to that of Maxine Waters, but there was no \"member's only\" elevator to flee into. Finally, Ellison fled the scene, hounding by Loomer and others questioning him about the abuse. The irony is of Ellison's campaign calling on the police to protect him from a woman, armed with a mic and camera phone, who is simply asking him to respond to the accusations and police report, as well as how he plans on being attorney general without a license, when he has shown his support for those that murder police officers in cold blood. Scott Johnson reports on Ellison's sordid history supporting such criminals. Ellison was an active supporter and local leader of the Nation of Islam in Minneapolis before his election to Congress. (I set forth this history in some detail in the October 9, 2006 issue of The Weekly Standard.) Ellison has baldly dissembled about this history since 2006. In his 2014 memoir My Country, \u2019Tis of Thee ,for example, Ellison simply omitted it and presented himself as a critic of Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam. This past June, Ellison told Jake Tapper on CNN, \u201cI worked on the Million Man March and I was proud to do so. That\u2019s it.\u201d But that wasn\u2019t it. Ellison first sought office as a Democrat in 1998 as Keith Ellison-Muhammad, a self-avowed member of the Nation of Islam. (Ellison-Muhammad is just one of three Nation of Islam names Ellison has used over the years.) Fortunately for him, Ellison\u2019s 5th District constituents haven\u2019t much cared about his history and the Minneapolis Star Tribune has almost entirely let it rest exactly where Ellison wants it. But seeking the top law enforcement job in Minnesota and running for statewide office should be a more daunting challenge because Ellison is an extraordinarily poor fit for the job. Among the troubling threads that run through Ellison\u2019s career: support for cop killers. In September 1992 Minneapolis police officer Jerry Haaf was murdered execution-style, shot in the back as he took a coffee break at a restaurant in south Minneapolis. Police later determined that Haaf\u2019s murder was a gang hit performed by four members of the city\u2019s Vice Lords gang.The leader of the Vice Lords was Sharif Willis, a convicted murderer who had been released from prison and who sought respectability as a responsible gang leader from gullible municipal authorities while operating a gang front called United for Peace. The four Vice Lords members who murdered Haaf met and planned the murder at Willis\u2019s house. Despite the fact that two witnesses implicated Willis in the planning he was never charged because law enforcement authorities said they lacked sufficient evidence to convict him. At the time, Ellison was a Minneapolis attorney in private practice. And within a month of Haaf\u2019s murder, Ellison appeared with Willis supporting the United for Peace gang front. In October 1992, Ellison helped organize a demonstration against Minneapolis police that included United for Peace. \u201cThe main\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

Bishop Eleganti\u2019s support of the profession comes just three days after Bishop Athanasius Schneider, auxiliary of Astana, Kazakstan, invited the world\u2019s bishops to sign the document and join in raising a common voice in defense of the sanctity and the indissolubility of marriage. \u201cGod decides the time, and the time will come when the Pope and the episcopacy again will proclaim, with all clarity, unambiguity and beauty, the sanctity of marriage, and of the family, and of the Eucharist,\u201d Schneider told LifesiteNews in an exclusive Jan. 15 interview. Raising a Common Voice In conversation with LifeSiteNews, Schneider said greater public support of the document from the world\u2019s 5,000 bishops would be \u201ca stronger voice for professing the constant truths of the Church, and it would be a beautiful common voice defending the sanctity and the indissolubility of marriage in the midst of a real neo-pagan society where divorce has become a plague and where sexual depravity is increasingly spreading.\u201d The Profession of Immutable Truths about Sacramental Marriage was issued by three Kazakh Ordinaries, including Bishop Schneider, in early January. In the document, the three bishops solemnly professed the Church\u2019s received teaching and discipline regarding sacramental marriage and the limited conditions (see Familiaris Consortio, n. 84) under which Catholics who are divorced and \u201cremarried\u201d may receive sacramental absolution and Holy Communion. They presented their profession \u201cbefore God who will judge us,\u201d in response to certain pastoral norms issued by several bishops\u2019 conferences aimed at implementing chapter 8 of Pope Francis\u2019 apostolic exhortation on the family, Amoris Laetitia. Some of these norms, Schneider told LifeSiteNews, give \u201cimplicit approval\u201d of divorce and of sexual activity outside a valid marriage. Such a reading is causing \u201crampant confusion,\u201d will spread \u201ca plague of divorce\u201d in the Church, and is \u201calien\u201d to the Church\u2019s entire faith and Tradition, the three bishops said in the profession. \u201cThis is contrary to Divine Revelation,\u201d Schneider further told LifeSite, adding that the \u201cbeautiful explanations\u201d that are being presented to clergy and faithful as \u201cdiscernment\u201d and \u201cpastoral accompaniment,\u201d or a \u201cchange of paradigm\u201d and \u201cdiscovery of the subjective part of the truth,\u201d when translated into \u201ccommon sense language,\u201d are tantamount to an allowance to sin. \u201cOur conscience as bishops calls to us to do this,\u201d Schneider explained. \u201cWe were forced by our conscience, in the conscience of the Successors of the Apostles and colleagues of the Pope.\u201d As Successors of the Apostles, Schneider said they \u201ccould not act in another way.\u201d Bishop Marian Eleganti The profession\u2019s most recent signatory, Bishop Marian Eleganti, O.S.B., is a monk of the abbey of the Missionary Benedictines in St. Otmarsberg in Uznach, located in the canton of St. Gallen, Switzerland. He was ordained to the priesthood on June 23, 1995. In July 1999, the monks of St. Otmarsberg Abbey (the youngest abbey in Switzerland) elected Eleganti the second abbot of the monastery. The Missionary Benedictines in Uznach belong to the Benedictine Congregation of St. Ottilien near Munich, with branches in Europe, East, West and South Africa, South America, Cuba and the USA, India, Korea, China, Kazakhstan and the Philippines. In 2009, Pope Benedict XVI appointed Abbot Marian Eleganti as auxiliary bishop of the diocese of Chur, Switzerland. He was ordained a bishop on Jan. 31, 2010. Since 2011, Bishop Eleganti has served as the Swiss Youth Bishop for German-speaking Switzerland on behalf of the Swiss Bishops\u2019 Conference, and as vicar for religious and monastic communities. He is also the vicar for the philosophical-theological education and ongoing formation and training of pastoral workers. Bishop Marian Eleganti\u2019s public support of the Profession of Immutable Truths about Sacramental Marriage brings the number of signatories to nine. To date, in addition to the three original signatories from Kazakstan, the following prelates have signed the profession: Cardinal Janis Pujats, Emeritus Archbishop Metropolitan of Riga, Latvia; Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigan\u00f2, former apostolic nuncio to the United States; His Excellency Luigi Negri, Archbishop emeritus of Ferrara-Comacchio, Italy; Bishop Andreas Laun, Emeritus Auxiliary of Salzburg, Austria; and His Excellency Rene Gracida, Bishop emeritus of Corpus Christi, Texas, USA.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

By combining data and observations from decades of Sun research, experts are predicting a \u201cGrand Solar Minimum\u201d will occur a few decades from now, making our parent star dimmer and cooler than it has been for a very long time. The Sun might look the same to you today as it has since the first time you laid eyes on it, but our star actually displays plenty of changes. The Sun goes through regular cycles of solar minimums and solar maximums, which are periods where the Sun is either quite calm (the minimum) or incredibly active (the maximum). These patterns repeat every 11 years or so, but new research suggests that there\u2019s a pattern behind the pattern, and that a particularly cool solar minimum is on the way. The study, which was published in Astrophysical Journal Letters, was carried out by a team led by physicist Dan Lubin of the University of California, San Diego. After combing the data, Lubin\u2019s team has forecasted a grand minimum that will be around seven percent cooler than the typical solar minimum, making it a particularly calm moment for our star. During a solar minimum, the Sun produces far fewer solar flares and sunspots, and as a result, much less ultraviolet radiation is shot out into space and towards Earth. This can have a number of effects on our planet, including changes in the thickness of the stratospheric ozone layer and temperatures far above ground. Those changes can affect weather, though forecasting specific differences has proven difficult. The grand minimum will be an exaggerated version of the typical solar minimum, and could produce some very noticeable effects. The most recent grand minimum is thought to have occurred back in the mid 1600s. The event, called the Maunder Minimum, is credited with plunging temperatures to the point where the Thames River and Baltic Sea froze over. However, other parts of the planet heated up, including Alaska and Greenland, to far above their normal highs. This temporary shakeup of temperatures could happen again, though the researchers say it will have very little effect on the overall global warming trend that mankind has created for itself.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

Security guards with at least one hospital have been tasked with forcefully keeping black death patients in the hospital as well as following the strict safety procedures set up in an attempt to quell the outbreak. The Sun reported: Officials at the hospital say the main reason why patients run away is that they are scared of needles and don\u2019t have much experience of hospitals. Jean Benoit Manhes, the deputy representative of Unicef, told the Irish Times: \u201cSome escaped because they\u2019re afraid of needles. People here are not used to the hospital. \u201cThe problem of plague is not just a medical response. You can have hospitals but if people don\u2019t come it isn\u2019t enough.\u201d Such incidents have prompted fears that the plague could spread even further with each confirmed case requiring 20 people have been in contact with to be treated as a precaution. Malagasy people have also been told not to carry out their traditional burial tradition of Famidihana which involves digging up their dead relatives every seven years. It means \u2018turning the bones\u2019 and sees families cleaning the remains, rewrapping them and reburying them while other family members perform a special dance. The African island\u2019s government has told citizens to pause the tradition for fear the plague bacteria is still active in the corpses and can be spread to the living. News of infected patients running away from hospitals comes on the heels of reports that it is only a matter of time before the plague becomes resistant to the antibiotics that are currently being used to treat the outbreak. Mac Slavo recently reported for SHTFplan: The newest warning about the outbreak of the airborne pneumonic plague, or black death, in Madagascar has been released. Officials warn that it\u2019s inevitable that this bacterial infection that\u2019s infected over 2000 people will become resistant to antibiotics. The only way to treat a person who has contracted the plague is with antibiotics. But experts now warn that because they are being used so much to treat the infection, antibiotics resistance is inevitable and making this disease much more terrifying. Once the bacteria is resistant, the Madagascar healthcare system will be overwhelmed, and the disease will have control of the nation. As Slavo noted, should the disease spread to the African mainland, one can assume that it will be all but impossible to control, thus increasing the likelihood of global pandemic.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

A Muslim named Hafiz Kazi, according to the Times, \u201cdrove a burning minivan filled with propane and gas tanks into the front gate of Travis Air Force Base in Northern California.\u201d After scrutinizing all the evidence closely, the FBI just can\u2019t figure out what could possibly have been Kazi\u2019s motive. And that in a nutshell shows what\u2019s wrong with today\u2019s FBI. Sean Ragan, FBI special agent in charge of the Sacramento field office, stated: \u201cWe don\u2019t have any nexus of terrorism at this point. Now the question is, why. Why was he there? What led him there? And we don\u2019t know answers to that, quite frankly.\u201d The Times noted that when emergency responders approached the burning van after it crashed, \u201cthey found five propane tanks, three plastic one-gallon gas cans, several lighters, three phones and a gym bag with personal items, Ragan said.\u201d Yes, what Kazi could possibly have been up to is a complete mystery. The Times added that \u201cthe dead man\u2019s religious beliefs and affiliation are not known at this point, said Ragan, who debunked a rumor that some sort of \u2018jihad\u2019 video was found on Kazi\u2019s phone.\u201d All right. No jihad video. And no \u201cnexus of terrorism,\u201d according to Sean Ragan. What is a nexus of terrorism? Ragan most likely means that investigators didn\u2019t find an ISIS membership card in Kazi\u2019s wallet, or lots of phone calls to Iraq or Syria, or a note from Kazi reading, \u201cI did this for Allah and Islam. Allahu akbar.\u201d Of course, even if they had found those things, given the FBI\u2019s recent track record of denial and deception, they may still be searching for Kazi\u2019s motive. In any case, a larger point is being lost here. And that is that there is a war going on. We know that the Islamic State, al-Qaeda and other groups have called upon Muslims in the U.S. to try to kill military personnel and police, as well as civilians. We know that Kazi, with all the propane and gas tanks in his car, was clearly trying to set off a major fire that would kill more people than just himself. Even if he wasn\u2019t on the phone to Baghdadi, the likelihood is that when a Muslim drives into a U.S. Air Force Base with a car full of incendiaries, probably this has something to do with the global jihad. The FBI\u2019s bafflement here is part of its deep, deep corruption. The FBI doesn\u2019t acknowledge that there is a global jihad, or that Islam has anything to do with terrorism. It doesn\u2019t admit that there is a war going on, and treats each act of Islamic terror as if it were a separate and discrete criminal event, unrelated to all the others. So each time something like this happens, they\u2019re back at Square One, trying to figure out motive. It\u2019s as if the U.S. Army stopped to interrogate every German soldier who crashed through the Ardennes Forest at the beginning of the Battle of the Bulge in 1944, to see if each one\u2019s actions had anything to do with the German Army and Adolf Hitler\u2019s war aims. Authorities are also investigating whether or not Kazi was suffering from any mental health issues. Here again, this is just more of the general refusal to acknowledge the 800-pound gorilla sitting in the living room and screaming \u201cAllahu akbar.\u201d Sean Ragan might explain to us that authorities are also trying to determine whether the German invasion of Poland in September 1939 was motivated by Nazism, or by mental health issues among the German High Command. This willful ignorance leads to a diversion and waste of resources that is astronomical and catastrophic. How long is this comic opera going to continue? If the jihadis advance even into the FBI\u2019s Sacramento offices, will agents there be struggling to determine the jihadis\u2019 motive even as the machete begins to slice through their necks?

Given that Pope Francis has, since that interview took place, attempted to make the Argentine bishops\u2019 interpretation of AL 'magisterial'--an interpretation that allows public adulterers to receive Holy Communion--Cardinal Burke\u2019s reply to my question on January 9th of this year would seem to take on new relevancy. In my interview of Raymond Cardinal Burke less than one year ago, I asked His Eminence to clarify what, exactly, is the level of authoritative weight of Pope Francis\u2019s post-synodal exhortation, Amoris Laetitia. Now, Cardinal Francesco Coccopalmerio, president of the Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts, made it very clear to the Catholic News Service on December 5 what the Pope is up to: \u201cThe fact that the pope requested that his letter and the interpretations of the Buenos Aires bishops be published in the AAS means that His Holiness has given these documents a particular qualification that elevates them to the level of being official teachings of the church. While the content of the pope\u2019s letter itself does not contain teachings on faith and morals, it does point toward the interpretations of the Argentine bishops and confirms them as authentically reflecting his own mind. Thus together the two documents became the Holy Father\u2019s authentic magisterium for the whole church.\u201d What Cardinal Burke rightly describes as lacking in any magisterial weight whatsoever\u2014and, in fact, in dire need of clarification and correction\u2014 has by papal fiat been declared magisterial, and thus binding on us all. Francis made it clear that the Argentine bishops\u2019 interpretation of AL allowing public adulterers to receive Holy Communion \u201cexplains precisely the meaning of Chapter VIII of \u2018Amoris Laetitia.\u2019 There are no other interpretations.\u201d I would imagine this outrageous overreach of papal authority on the Pope's part would make it ominously clear to Cardinal Burke that the time has come to issue his public correction of Pope Francis's erroneous teaching. The moment, it would seem, has come. Cardinal Burke, please and in God's Holy Name, we beg you to act now -- before Pope Francis succeeds in tearing the Church in half completely. We fear that your silence now, in the face of this latest papal travesty, may suggest consent to the claim that Amoris Laetitia is magisterial, and thus prove more damaging than if you had never raised your voice at all.

Don't count on these comments by a Congressional Black Cacus member to get reported either. Democratic Illinois Rep. Danny Davis defended Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan as an \u201coutstanding human being\u201d on Monday. Farrakhan\u2019s history of racially extreme comments includes blaming Jews for the September 11 attacks, saying white people \u201cdeserve to die\u201d and praising Adolf Hitler as a \u201cvery great man.\u201d \u201cI personally know [Farrakhan], I\u2019ve been to his home, done meetings, participated in events with him,\u201d Davis told TheDC. \u201cI don\u2019t regard Louis Farrakhan as an aberration or anything, I regard him as an outstanding human being who commands a following of individuals who are learned and articulate and he plays a big role in the lives of thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of people,\u201d he emphasized later. When asked about Farrakhan\u2019s history of anti-Semitic comments, Davis was dismissive and said that many people in politics have a history of inflammatory comments. Like this.

Add the internet and you get a perfect storm of sociology stupidity. The story concerns Ashley Arnold, a 27-year-old working on an online sociology degree. As part of her final class, for which she paid almost $1,000, students were required to complete a project outline last month in which they would compare a social norm in the US and another country. For her \"norm\" Arnold picked social media use, and for her country she chose Australia. But when Arnold got her grade back on Feb. 1, she was shocked to see her professor had failed her. Why? Because, according to the teacher, \"Australia is a continent; not a country.\" Sociology. You really don't need to know anything. The professor, who has a PhD in philosophy... Of course she does. I believe I got zero or partial credit because the instructor said, 'Australia is a continent; not a country. However, I believe that Australia is a country.

            "question": "Which of the following tactics is used in the following text?\n\nArticle: Rep. Danny Davis was For/Against/For/Against Farrakhan Rep. Danny Davis helped get the ball rolling by praising Farrakhan. Democratic Illinois Rep. Danny Davis defended Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan as an \u201coutstanding human being\u201d on Monday. Farrakhan\u2019s history of racially extreme comments includes blaming Jews for the September 11 attacks, saying white people \u201cdeserve to die\u201d and praising Adolf Hitler as a \u201cvery great man.\u201d \u201cI personally know [Farrakhan], I\u2019ve been to his home, done meetings, participated in events with him,\u201d Davis told TheDC. \u201cI don\u2019t regard Louis Farrakhan as an aberration or anything, I regard him as an outstanding human being who commands a following of individuals who are learned and articulate and he plays a big role in the lives of thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of people,\u201d he emphasized later. Then Rep. Davis' office issued a statement disavowing Farrakhan. And then Davis got right back to talking to the Daily Caller and disavowed the disavowal. \u201cThe congressman was insistent that The Daily Caller misquoted him during the interview and that he didn\u2019t subscribe to Farrakhan\u2019s anti-Semitic statements and actions in the past,\u201d the ADL official told JTA in a statement. \u201cHe expressed an interest in seeing some of the latest statements made by Farrakhan vis-a-vis Jews, which we promptly shared with him.\u201d The congressman wasn\u2019t sure why the ADL wrote that he had been misquoted in his praise for the anti-Semite, and said he wasn\u2019t sure if someone from his office had told the ADL he was misquoted, he told The Daily Caller News Foundation on Sunday. \u201cI think that was what they wanted to write. Nah, I don\u2019t have no problems with Farrakhan, I don\u2019t spend a whole lot of my time dealing with those kind of things,\u201d Davis said. \u201cThat\u2019s just one segment of what goes on in our world. The world is so much bigger than Farrakhan and the Jewish question and his position on that and so forth. For those heavy into it, that\u2019s their thing, but it ain\u2019t my thing,\u201d he said The term \"Jewish Question\" is largely used by anti-Semites. So Davis then sorta disavowed his own statements. J Street endorsed him. And then he talked to the Daily Caller again. Democratic Illinois Rep. Danny Davis thinks Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, a notorious racist and anti-Semite, does \u201coutstanding work\u201d but doesn\u2019t agree with Farrakhan\u2019s positions that white people are \u201cdevils\u201d and Jewish people are satanic. Progress! \"I don\u2019t spend a lot of time, I buy Final Call when I see them. I\u2019ve been to Saviour\u2019s Day, I\u2019ve read, I\u2019ve been a fan of Elijah Muhammad, so those are my positions, but I do disagree with the notion that white people are devils.\u201d I wonder how far a white congressman would get saying, \"I attended the Klavern, but I don't agree with the KKK's views about black people.\" But that's Rep. Davis' current views. He likes a racist hate group. But doesn't believe white people are devils or Jews are satanic. Whoever the JTA has on the \"explain away Farrakhan's Dem fandom\" beat is going to be busy again. But this is typical of the Dems and their useful idiots. And J Street is on record as endorsing a politician who praised a racist hate group leader and discussed the \"Jewish question.\"\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

Part of the hypocrisy of the US Conference of Mayors is that they actually push to infringe on law-abiding citizens' rights while claiming that it is consistent with the Second Amendment. For example, the organization writes in support of David Hogg's #NeverAgain movement, \"WHEREAS, the U.S. Conference of Mayors has a 50-year history of formally adopting and aggressively promoting strong policies to reduce gun violence, all consistent with its support for the Second Amendment to the Constitution.\" take our poll - story continues below Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?

And just what kind of policies are we talking about? According to the mayors: Strengthening the Regulation of Gun Sales and Dealers, including: Limiting the number of guns a person may purchase in a single transaction or in a month or other specified period of time; Banning replica handguns; Increasing inspections of licensed gun dealers; and Targeting and holding responsible gun dealers who break the law by knowingly selling guns to straw purchasers; Banning Assault Weapons and Large-Capacity Magazines, including: Reinstating a strengthened, effective ban on military-style assault weapons, such as AK-47s, and their component parts; and Banning large capacity ammunition feeding devices and the importation of all large capacity ammunition clips. Supporting Local Efforts to Reduce and Combat Gun Crimes, including: Opposing concealed carry reciprocity policies and legislation that would circumvent city policies established to protect residents; Providing local governments and law enforcement officials access to ATF gun trace data; Opposing \"Stand Your Ground\"\u009d or \"Shoot First\"\u009d laws and urging state legislatures that have adopted such laws to repeal them; and Encouraging mayors to take executive actions to combat gun violence and illegal use and trafficking of guns; Protecting Young People, including: Opposing proposals to allow teachers and other non-law enforcement, non-security personnel to carry firearms in K-12 schools; Raising the youth handgun ban from 18 to 21 years of age; Banning juvenile possession of semiautomatic assault rifles; and Holding gun owners criminally liable when children gain access to improperly stored guns. Protecting Domestic Violence Victims, including: Prohibiting persons convicted of domestic violence crimes or subject to final domestic violence restraining orders from acquiring or possessing firearms; and Requiring prohibited domestic abusers to turn in firearms they already own; How any of this is consistent with support for the Second Amendment is anyone's guess. I think they throw that language in to cover for the fact that they are attacking it head on and attacking the rights of the people. How does any of this stop gun violence? It doesn't. What it does do is infringe on the rights of teachers, law-abiding citizens who want to purchase several guns which they will use lawfully, sides with criminals against law-abiding citizens as it opposes stand your ground and other measures written specifically to protect people who would normally be victims of crime. Banning semi-automatic weapons doesn't stop crime either, as we've pointed out before, and the statistics are available for anyone to see that gun violence didn't go down one bit during the decade of the Clinton/Feinstein assault weapons ban. These geniuses also \"Support Enactment of Comprehensive Background Checks, Ban the Sale of Bump Stocks and Related Devices and Prevent the Arming of Teachers in Schools.\" Again, this will do nothing to stop criminals with guns. Why? Because they won't follow your unconstitutional and unlawful laws in the first place! On top of that, the criminal mayors want to institute red flag laws. \"The U.S. Conference of Mayors registers its strong support for extreme risk protection order laws and urges both states and the federal government to enact such laws,\" the group wrote. They are fully in support of violating the Fifth Amendment rights of otherwise law-abiding citizens based on merely the fact that someone claims that a family member is a harm to themselves or others, even though they have not committed a crime. This is the Trump, \"Take the guns first and then due process\" mantra. Guns.com reported on some of the statements made by some of these mayors. Karen Freeman-Wilson, mayor of Gary, Indiana and chairwoman of the conference\u2019s criminal and social justice committee, said gun-related tragedies \u201crips families and communities apart.\u201d \u201cPolicies like background checks on all gun sales and Red Flag Laws save lives. It\u2019s as simple as that,\u201d Freeman-Wilson said. \u201cThe U.S. Conference of Mayors will continue doing everything in our power to keep our communities safe so that children and families are able to live free of the fear of being gunned down.\u201d St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson said the new resolutions show mayors will \u201clead the way in solving our gun violence crisis.\u201d \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be doing our jobs as mayors if we weren\u2019t focusing on gun violence \u2014 an issue that threatens the public safety of every community, big and small,\u201d she said. \u201cOur bipartisan network of mayors knows how to work together and compromise on policies that save lives.

Of course, RINO Senator Jeff Flake (R-AZ) wanted to side with Senate Democrats in pushing for a FBI investigation into unsubstantiated allegations against Kavanaugh. Outgoing Flake, and good riddance, said that he sided with his colleagues in having a \"limited time and scope\" investigation by the FBI into the allegations against Kavanaugh.

Why that investigation is needed is unclear since all the people Dr. Christine Ford named to be at the alleged house where the alleged attack took place all categorically denied the attack took place, including Ford's girl friend. The committee also voted against Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and his motion to subpoena Mark Judge before the committee. While Democrats appeared stunned, specifically self-professed sexual assaulter Cory Booker and Kamila Harris, that they were in the minority and couldn't control things despite eight years under the Obama regime where Republicans were subjected to far worse, the vote carried and Kavanaugh will be voted on in the US Senate.

            "question": "Which of the following tactics is used in the following text?\n\nArticle: Why Louis Farrakhan Is Back in the News Louis Farrakhan, the 84-year-old head of the Nation of Islam, has been back in the headlines after a previously unreleased photo of him with President Barack Obama was published in January and Mr. Farrakhan gave an anti-Semitic speech at his organization\u2019s annual convention last month. The Feb. 25 speech, which was given at an event for Saviour\u2019s Day, a religious gathering of the Nation, ran for almost three hours. During it, Mr. Farrakhan said that the \u201cpowerful Jews\u201d were his enemies, and that Jews were \u201cresponsible for all of this filth and degenerate behavior that Hollywood is putting out turning men into women and women into men,\u201d as well as other incendiary remarks. A religious fundamentalist whose group has been condemned by the Southern Poverty Law Center, Mr. Farrakhan is fervently opposed to the legitimacy of the state of Israel, and his political positions regarding the country frequently spill over into bigoted remarks about Jews, which is why many public officials have avoided association with him. Mr. Farrakhan has denied that he is anti-Semitic and has even said that his father may have been Jewish. Much of the recent coverage has been focused on Tamika Mallory, one of the heads of the Women\u2019s March organization, who attended the Feb. 25 speech, and on Representative Danny Davis, a Democrat of Illinois, who defended Mr. Obama and Mr. Farrakhan after the photo came to light. Their reluctance to condemn Mr. Farrakhan has led to criticism from across the ideological spectrum this week. What is the Nation of Islam? The Nation of Islam is a political and religious movement that was started by W.D. Fard Muhammad in 1931 and continued by Elijah Muhammad in 1933. It first became prominent after a man named Malcolm Little joined the organization. Encouraged by Elijah Muhammad, he changed his last name to X and became a minister in the movement. Edward E. Curtis IV, the author of \u201cBlack Muslim Religion in the Nation of Islam,\u201d said that while estimates ranged wildly about how many bona fide members belonged to the Nation, he believes that there were tens of thousands of members in the 1960s and early 1970s. But he said that millions of others sympathized with the movement\u2019s anticolonial stance and were inspired by its most famous member, Muhammad Ali. Who is Louis Farrakhan? Born Louis Eugene Walcott in New York in 1933, Mr. Farrakhan joined the Nation of Islam in the mid-1950s and rose quickly within the organization, becoming close to Malcolm X. After the assassination of Malcolm X in 1965, he became one of the most powerful members of the Nation and its chief spokesman, the position that Malcolm X had held. The Nation of Islam had gained followers around the nation in the 1940s and \u201950s by providing something of a religious answer to antiblack racism. It was not widely recognized as an anti-Jewish organization during its early years (its early literature, though, focused on \u201cthe white man\u201d as \u201cthe white devil\u201d). But in 1967, it became outspokenly and flagrantly anti-Zionist, in an expression of solidarity with Palestinians. That political position became a vehicle for Mr. Farrakhan to express his anti-Semitism. (Among his more infamous comments is his 1984 description of Adolf Hitler as \u201ca very great man.\u201d) In 1975, when Elijah Muhammad died, the Nation split into two factions. The faction reconstituted under Mr. Farrakhan in the late 1970s retained the original name, though not the influence or support that it had when its leaders were Malcolm X, Muhammad Ali and Elijah Muhammad. Mr. Curtis said that today the membership could be in the thousands, and there could even be as many as 10,000 followers. Mr. Farrakhan, whose name, the Anti-Defamation League wrote after the February event, is \u201cvirtually synonymous with anti-Semitism,\u201d then drew national attention in 1984, when he exhorted his followers to support Jesse Jackson\u2019s bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. In a radio address, he urged listeners to \u201cmake an example\u201d of a Washington Post reporter who had reported that Mr. Jackson had used anti-Semitic terms in private. Mr. Jackson repudiated Mr. Farrakhan, but the minister\u2019s support proved troublesome to his 1988 campaign as well. He was back in the news in 1995 when he organized what became known as the \u201cMillion Man March,\u201d a political and religious revival event in Washington. Why were Tamika Mallory and Danny Davis reluctant to denounce him? Ms. Mallory, who declined to comment for this article, did not respond to calls to condemn Mr. Farrakhan, for whom she had expressed admiration in the past. On March 3, she said on Twitter that someone had brought to her attention that she had yet to tweet \u201cmy absolute position on how wrong anti-Semitism is.\u201d A day later, she said that she was \u201ccommitted to ending anti-black racism, anti-Semitism, homophobia & transphobia,\u201d but did not mention Mr. Farrakhan. In an essay posted Wednesday, she said that she had been attending Saviour\u2019s Day celebrations for over 30 years. \u201cIn that most difficult period of my life, it was the women of the Nation of Islam who supported me and I have always held them close to my heart for that reason,\u201d she said. The essay did not mention Mr. Farrakhan. Asked what the appeal of Mr. Farrakhan\u2019s views might be to people like Ms. Mallory, religious scholars emphasized that the Nation of Islam is a religion and can provide comfort and aid to its adherents. \u201cFor those who find it appealing, it is a form of radical black self love that is willing to challenge any potential impediment to black freedom,\u201d Mr. Curtis said. Yvonne Chireau, a professor of religion at Swarthmore who called Mr. Farrakhan\u2019s remarks about Jews \u201cunbelievably vile,\u201d emphasized that his fundamentalism was comparable to the fundamentalist views found in other religions.

That means turning our country into a hopeless hellhole where the native population is overtaxed and terrorized by warring foreign gangs. We're getting there too. What should we do? Maybe we should be more like Sweden? Sweden will do whatever it takes, including sending in the army, to end a wave of gang violence that has seen a string of deadly shootings, Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said in Wednesday. Sweden's murder rate is relatively low in international terms, but gang violence has surged in recent years and Swedes are worried that the police are unable to cope. Of course they can't cope. It's Demolition Man in real life pitting refugee war criminals and terrorists against bureaucrats with badges who are used to telling people not to raise their voices. Four people were shot dead in the first week of this year. One man died after picking up a hand grenade outside a subway station in a suburb of Stockholm. Law and order is likely to be a major issue in a parliamentary election scheduled for September with the populist, opposition Sweden Democrats linking public concern about the rising crime rate to a large increase in the numbers of immigrants. \"It would not be my first option to bring in the military, but I am prepared to do whatever is necessary to make sure that serious, organized crime is stamped out,\" Lofven told news agency TT. Bringing in the military comes in as an option ahead of cutting migration to Sweden. That tells you everything. Why would anyone associate rising crime and immigration? Maybe because the gangs in question are immigrant gangs. The government has promised police an extra 7.1 billion crowns ($880 million) through 2020, toughened laws on gun crimes and made it easier for the police to monitor private phone calls and emails, among other measures. Sound familiar? Mass repression and police powers that don't actually address the cause of the problem. Meanwhile the Grenade Amnesty doesn't seem to have worked. And the gang violence keeps rising. But who are these gangs? The criminal gang Loyal to Familia has already spread across Denmark from its base in the N\u00f8rrebro district of Copenhagen and now it appears to have set its sights on Sweden. Swedish police told the Danish tabloid Ekstra Bladet that the gang is trying to build a presence in both Malm\u00f6 and Helsingborg. An expansion into Malm\u00f6 could be a recipe for increased violence in light of the fact that gun violence claimed the lives of 11 people in the southern Swedish city last year. The gang's leader, Shuaib Khan, confirmed that the group is eyeing the two Swedish cities but denied that Loyal to Familia was a \u201ccriminal gang\u201d.

Note the claims \u2013 utterly disingenuous, as it turns out \u2013 that the labeling of certain people or groups as \u201cviolent extremists\u201d is entirely due to their own behavior; in other words, don\u2019t worry, folks, it\u2019s all scientifically objective. This research is being used to advise companies who host online platforms, such as Facebook, as well as governments, on how to stamp out online radicalization \u2013 using strategies such as working out ways of preventing people from seeing material posted that is deemed unsuitable in some way, or offering them alternative \u201cnice\u201d things to look at. This is a seriously important issue. The people and political powers behind such initiatives are manipulating behavior online and literally controlling how people think and get information. They are the appointed guardians of the online hoi polloi. But who guards the guardians? For if Dr. Ganesh is in charge, we have some very worrying questions to ask. One could start from the observation that the article is certainly not an academic piece, and gives no concrete evidence for any of the sweeping claims it makes about the so-called \u201calt-right\u201d and the \u201cmanosphere\u201d; nor does it, as any academic should do, attempt to test ideas and consider alternative explanations. (Oddly enough, this makes it rather like the groups it claims to criticize.) And the label of \u201cviolent extremist\u201d turns out to be used very generously. Ganesh makes wild leaps and inferences. He talks of Darren Osborne, the perpetrator of the vehicular attack on Finsbury Park Mosque. This was a heinous crime, and should rightly be condemned. But why did Osborne do this, according to Ganesh? The attack \u201cwas executed after he had become indignant after watching a BBC broadcast on child sexual exploitation and turned to social media to make sense of it. He found a narrative from British counter-jihad groups closely aligned with the alt-right, such as Britain First and the founder of the English Defence League Tommy Robinson.\u201d The British counter-jihad movement is thus swept into the same group of violent extremists as Osborne, because Ganesh \u201cknows\u201d they encouraged him. The BBC broadcast was the drama based on real life, Three Girls, which showed real-life events of three of the (very many) victims of the Rochdale Muslim rape gangs. Ganesh somehow knows precisely what went on in Osborne\u2019s mind. Rather than thinking that it was outrage at the behavior of the gangs of Muslim men of Pakistani background who abused the girls portrayed in Three Girls that caused Osborne to lose his mind and commit his terrible crime, Ganesh blames Obsorne\u2019s act on the likes of Tommy Robinson. Yet Robinson explicitly fights AGAINST political violence. What \u201cnarrative from British counter-jihad groups\u201d can one find which suggests driving vehicles into innocent Muslims standing outside a mosque? I\u2019m sure if there was any, Ganesh would, as a researcher at an elite institution, be able to find it. But there is none offered \u2013 only surmise and Ganesh\u2019s mindreading techniques. I suppose if you\u2019re paid to fight online extremism, you\u2019d better find it, or you\u2019re out of a job and short of academic publication. We have also the ridiculous idea that Tommy Robinson is \u201calt-right.\u201d He, in fact, describes himself as a centrist \u2013 he\u2019s said he agrees with Labour on some things, the Tories on other things, and he left the EDL precisely because he didn\u2019t like the infiltration by the far right. He shows no hint of racism or of white supremacism. The writer of this shoddy article is working at one of the most elite universities in the world, on research funded by the European Union, and giving advice based on this sloppy thinking to those who are in charge of manipulating and policing the communications and information we have online. We have to ask.

            "question": "Which of the following tactics is used in the following text?\n\nArticle: The Death Penalty, Instituted by God Himself (The Biblical Basis for Catholic Teaching on Capital Punishment) TO ARGUE AGAINST THE DEATH PENALTY is to contend with constituted reality. Ever since Adam and Eve committed the Original Sin, every living creature is subject to it. Every one of us is born on Death Row and lives out his allotted lifespan in its shadow without hope of reprieve. God made that clear when He told Adam that \u201cin what day soever\u201d he preferred his own will above his Creator\u2019s, \u201cthou shalt die the death,\u201d condemning him sooner or later to \u201creturn to the earth out of which thou wast taken: for dust thou art, and to dust thou shalt return\u201d (Gen. 3:19). In other words, there has always been a death penalty. God instituted it, and He was the first to impose it, embedding it in the very fabric of natural law. When Cain took it upon himself to inflict death on his brother Abel \u201cin the field,\u201d he soon learned that God furthermore reserved the exercise of this right to himself alone. Cain is told, \u201cWhat hast thou done? The voice of thy brother\u2019s blood crieth to me from the earth,\u201d and God curses him for his presumption by dooming him to homelessness and unproductive labor. When Cain complains that being a \u201cvagabond . . . on the earth, every one therefore that findeth me, shall kill me,\u201d God laid down that \u201cwhoever shall kill Cain shall be punished sevenfold,\u201d setting a mysterious identifying mark on him to protect him from the vengeance of others. The Fifth Commandment later delivered to Moses, \u201cThou shalt not kill,\u201d therefore dates from adamic times, when it operated as God\u2019s exclusive prerogative, allowing no exceptions. Although men certainly continued to kill one another in a society which in fact became so wicked \"that all the thought of their heart was bent upon evil at all times,\" they did so as murderers, outside God's law without legal right. Only after the Flood, when Noah and his sons set about repopulating the earth, did God delegate to human society His exclusive authority to impose the death penalty for just cause. He told Noah, \u201cFor I will require the blood of your lives at the hand of every beast, and at the hand of man, at the hand of every man, and of his brother, will I require the life of man. Whosoever shall shed man\u2019s blood, his blood shall be shed: for man was made to the image of God.\u201d In other words, from that point in history lawful killing in atonement for taking the life of another is sanctioned by God. After the great theophany on Sinai, Moses codified the death penalty as part of the old law of talion, which in strict justice required \u201clife for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot\u201d (Deut. 19:21). The supreme penalty was imposed not only for murder, but for many other serious offenses: for adultery, rape, sodomy, kidnapping, for striking or cursing parents, for sacrificing a child to Moloch. Idolatry, fortune-telling, acting as a medium, preaching apostasy or attempting in any way to entice another from the faith were also punishable by death, as was blasphemy, an offense considered so heinous that the Law specified, \u201cHe that blasphemeth the name of the Lord, dying let him die: all the multitude shall stone him, whether he be a native or a stranger\u201d (Lev. 24:16). Death was also decreed for refusing to accept the decision of the priests in a legal case, and an incorrigible son could be put to death on the testimony of his parents before the proper court. A priest\u2019s daughter convicted of fornication was burned to death (Lev. 21:9), but usually the sentence was carried out by stoning, in which the whole community took part as evidence that no private parties were authorized to execute a criminal, but only society as a whole, after due judgment. Everyone was furthermore responsible for the atonement due to God for a crime whose evil consequences would otherwise have affected them all: \u201cThe hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him to kill him, and afterwards the hands of the rest of the people; that thou mayest take away the evil out of the midst of thee\u201d (Deut. 17:7). The Law read, \u201cDefile not the land of your habitation which is stained with the blood of the innocent: neither can it otherwise be expiated, but by his blood that hath shed the blood of another\u201d (Num. 35:33). In order to emphasize the fact that it is God, and not man, who is always the principal party to be avenged, provision was made for a heifer to be killed as propitiation in the case of an unsolved murder whose perpetrator could not be found (Deut. 20:1-9). After all, it is not the injury to relatives or any other human consideration that makes homicide the serious sin that it is, but as God Himself pointed out to Noah, it is the fact that \u201cman was made to the image of God\u201d that makes an assault on him tantamount to an assault on God. It is therefore to God, and not to His creatures that reparation is primarily due. This point was brought out by Pope Pius XII in an address to Italian Catholic jurists on May 12, 1954, when he said: A penalty is the reaction required by law and justice in response to a fault: penalty and fault are action and reaction. Order violated by a culpable act demands the reintegration and re-establishment of the disturbed equilibrium . . . . A word must be said on the full meaning of penalty. Most of the modern theories of penal law explain penalty and justify it in the final analysis as a means of protection, that is, defense of the community against criminal undertakings,\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

Sandri would be one of a number of Bergoglian partisans at the conclave who are now said to be experiencing \u201cbuyer\u2019s remorse,\u201d as documented most recently in the explosive best-seller The Dictator Pope . \"When the shepherd becomes a wolf, the first duty of the flock is to defend itself. The true children of Holy Church, at such times, are those who walk by the light of their Baptism, not the cowardly souls who, under the specious pretext of submission to the powers that be, delay their opposition to the enemy in the hope of receiving instructions which are neither necessary nor desirable.\" Francis, writes Royal, \u201chas little use for established procedures, precedents, even legal structures within the Church\u2026. When the head of the Church himself does not much feel bound by the tradition or impartial laws he has inherited, what then?\u201d What then indeed? The Dictator Pope even feels at liberty to demand that the Lord\u2019s Prayer be changed to reflect his dissatisfaction with God\u2019s words: \u201cAnd lead us not into temptation [et ne nos inducas in tentationem],\u201d which Francis has decided, after 2,000 years, is a \u201cnot a good translation.\u201d Apparently lost on Francis, given the disordered m\u00e9lange of bits and pieces of things he has read that constitutes his theology, is the distinction between sin, a culpable act, and temptation, which arises from concupiscence or what Saint Thomas called the fomes, or the fleshly inclination to sin, which grace enables us to control by the rule of reason over the passions. But now we are witness to the single worst act of tyranny in the entire history of the papacy. The Church has seen a number of Popes who have abused their power, Alexander VI being the most popularly known example. But never, before Francis, has there been a Pope who dared to tyrannize the Magisterium itself by attempting to bend it to his errant personal opinions. By publication in the Acta Apostolicae Sedis (AAS), Francis has officially declared that the \u201cauthentic Magisterium\u201d includes the guidelines of the bishops of Buenos Aires for the implementation of Chapter 8 of Amoris Laetitia (AL), which he expressly approved in his letter to them as the only correct interpretation of his will. The guidelines have been published in the AAS along with Francis\u2019s private missive, which is suddenly declared to be \u201can apostolic letter.\u201d The normalist narrative has just been stripped of any colorable argument that nothing is too terribly amiss with this pontificate. We are now expected to believe that the \u201cauthentic Magisterium\u201d\u2014meaning simply and only AL\u2014teaches what the guidelines preposterously declare, solely in reliance on AL: When the concrete circumstances of a couple make it feasible, especially when both are Christians with a journey of faith, one may propose that they commit to living in continence\u2026. In other more complex circumstances, and when it is not possible to obtain a declaration of nullity, the aforementioned option may not, in fact, be viable. Nonetheless, it is equally possible to undertake a journey of discernment\u2026. [I]f one arrives at the recognition that, in a concrete case, there are limitations that diminish responsibility and culpability (cf. 301-302), particularly when a person judges that he would fall into a subsequent fault by damaging the children of the new union, Amoris Laetitia opens up the possibility of access to the Sacraments of Reconciliation and the Eucharist (cf. notes 336 and 351). As Francis would have it, then, the \u201cauthentic Magisterium\u201d has just flatly contradicted itself for the first time in two millennia: The admission of public adulterers in \u201csecond marriages\u201d to Holy Communion, which John Paul II, in line with all of Tradition, called \u201c intrinsically impossible \u201d given their objective state in life, is now deemed possible depending on circumstances\u2014that is, situation ethics applied to violations of the Sixth Commandment. The requirement that people embroiled in such unions commit to living in continence before they can be absolved and partake of the Blessed Sacrament\u2014a moral norm binding \u201c without exception \u201d because it is rooted in divine law\u2014is suddenly demoted to a mere \u201cproposal\u201d that may not be \u201cfeasible\u201d or \u201cviable\u201d in \u201cthe concrete circumstances of the couple.\u201d A valid annulment of a truly invalid marriage, the sine qua non for entering into marital relations with another purported spouse, is now dispensed with in \u201cmore complex circumstances\u2026 when it is not possible to obtain a declaration of nullity,\u201d the way thus being opened to de facto divorce in the Catholic Church. The meaningless slogan \u201cjourney of discernment\u201d cloaks a naked authorization for the official toleration of adulterous sexual relations in the Church\u2019s sacramental life. No less than a Roman Pontiff lends his name to the outrageous claim that children resulting from an adulterous relationship, blithely referred to as a \u201cnew union,\u201d could be \u201cdamaged\u201d if the partners in adultery were required to cease their adultery in order to be absolved and receive Holy Communion\u2014evidently because the \u201cnew union\u201d would dissolve without adulterous sexual relations and there could be a second divorce!\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

The backdoor tactics and machinations were brilliantly documented by Edward Pentin , Henry Sire, George Neumayr and an array of investigative journalists. The fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man knows himself to be a fool. \u2013 Shakespeare, As You Like It Pope Francis and Cardinal Farrell sit with students at the 2018 pre-synodal meeting for young people. The upcoming October 2018 Synod of Bishops guarantees more synodal antics as the doctrinal culmination of the \u201cWho Am I to Judge\u201d mantra and the recantation of Church teaching on homosexuality. Pope Francis announced in the Pre-Synodal meeting that the Church will be listening to all the young people and that \u201cno one will be excluded.\u201d That\u2019s code language that the Pope will be \u201cdialoging\u201d and \u201caccompanying\u201d and \u201chearing\u201d the pro-LBGT agenda. Oh, the providential irony! The two themes of the upcoming Synod of Bishops in Rome are none other than, Youth and Vocations. Sound familiar? Do I hear the Pennsylvania Grand Jury Report? How inconvenient that the two targets of predatory clerics and prelates will be the subject of the Synod of Bishops. How inconvenient that the head of the Synod on Youth and Vocations, Cardinal Kevin Farrell, was the former roommate of the most prolific serial predator of youth and seminarians in the history of the American Church. How inconvenient that Farrell, Head of this Synod on Youth, roomed with the notorious Cardinal Theodore McCarrick for six years and never knew anything about McCarrick\u2019s predatory behavior. How inconvenient that a global homosexual clergy predation scandal is erupting at a time when Francis wants the Synod to minimize that nagging and unmerciful Catholic catechism doctrine of homosexuality as \u201cintrinsically disordered\u201d by exploiting the naive views of the youth at the Synod. How inconvenient that homosexual predation is bankrupting the American Church and the Instrumentum Laboris, the working document of this Vatican Synodal Agenda, embraces the relaxation of the Church teachings on homosexuality. How inconvenient that the homosexual network of clergy and prelates were blasted as predators and coverup enablers in the Pennsylvania Grand Jury Report, while the Instrumentum Laboris argues that: \u201cSome LGBT youths, through various contributions that were received by the General Secretariat of the Synod, wish to benefit from greater closeness and experience greater care by the Church, while some Bishop Conferences ask themselves what to suggest to young people who decide to create homosexual instead of heterosexual couples and, above all, would like to be close to the Church.\u201d \u00a7197 IL How inconvenient that during a global prelate homosexual coverup scandal, the 2018 Synodal Bishop Conferences are exploring for ways during the Synod to discuss ways in which homosexual youths want to be \u201ccloser\u201d to the Church! How inconvenient that since 2013 during Francis\u2019 impromptu airplane presser when he cleverly sent a powerful message to homosexual clerics, \u201cWho Am I to Judge,\u201d now Francis must judge the criminal predatory conduct of homosexual clergy and prelates who preyed on youth and seminarians. The emerging homosexual clergy scandal is just beginning to unfold. The laity will learn over the course of the next few years that the underlying cause of the criminal scandal lies in the homosexual network of priests, bishops and cardinals who preyed on the youth, assaulted seminarians, promoted their own ilk, and punished any whistleblowers or noncompliant priests. Here is the dirty secret that is now emerging. Many in the hierarchy were active homosexuals who intentionally relaxed and ignored the Church\u2019s teaching and moral stance on homosexuality. The personal wreckage brutally portrayed in the Pennsylvania Grand Jury Report is the direct result of a clerical culture which embraced homosexuality and groomed, recruited, and assaulted young people into this sordid lifestyle. Many priests, bishops, and cardinals practiced what Francis preached, \u2018who am I to judge.\u2019 The result? A litany of lives of total moral, physical, emotional devastation suffered by victims of homosexual clerics. This is just the very beginning of the dark night of the soul of the Catholic Church. The upcoming Synod and its embrace of the \u201cLGBT\u201d lifestyle makes a mockery of the suffering of the clergy victims and justifies the decades-old scandal. Be forewarned that inviting young people from ages 16-29 to the Synod to discuss vocations with Bishops poses serious moral and physical dangers to these unsuspecting youth, many of whom think homosexuality is cool. And the Bishops know it. The full extent of the clerical predation in the hierarchy will take years to uncover. Until it has, this Synod must be cancelled while the civil authorities and law enforcement fully investigate the breadth and depth of the homosexual clerical predation. The warning signs and rainbow flags are flamboyantly flashing that the 2018 Synod on the Youth and Vocations in Rome presents great moral and physical exploitation of the youth. According to the Vatican, the chosen topic of the 2018 Synod, is an \u201cexpression of the Church\u2019s pastoral concern for the young,\u201d and is in continuity with the findings of the two-fold synod on the family and Francis\u2019s post-synodal document Amoris Laetitia. We\u2019ve caught on to his sneaky synodal tactics. Francis cleverly uses the synodal process to relax church doctrine by employing secular tools of surveys and focus groups. And, if the necessary results aren\u2019t computed, they will skewer the results. Magisterium by majority vote or stuff the ballot box. The only compelling \u201cexpression of the Church\u2019s pastoral concern for the young\u201d belongs in the full and transparent cooperation of criminal investigations into predatory homosexual predation. Turn over the documents secret archives involving predation, both in the Vatican and in the chanceries around the globe. That is the only expression that will demonstrate concern for the young.

With no sunspots reported in 96 days, the sun is going dark and the evidence could point to an approaching ice age. As the sun gets successively more blank with each day, due to lack of sunspots, it is also dimming, says the website Watts Up With That? According to data from NASA\u2019s Spaceweather, so far in 2017, 96 days (27%) of the days observing the sun have been without sunspots. Today at Cape Canaveral, SpaceXlaunched a new sensor to the International Space Station named TSIS-1. Its mission: to measure the dimming of the sun\u2019s irradiance. It will replace the aging SORCE spacecraft. NASA SDO reports that as the sunspot cycle plunges toward its 11-year minimum, NASA satellites are tracking a decline in total solar irradiance (TSI). \u2013Watts Up With That? The Daily Sheeple\u2019s Joe Joseph breaks it down for those who don\u2019t closely follow the sun\u2019s changes.

Solar activity, measured by the appearance of sun spots, has been declining at a greater rate than at any other time in history. And that could have widespread implications. A team of experts have warned that huge seismic events, including volcanic eruptions, plunging global temperatures and destabilization of the Earth\u2019s crust will become more common after worrying changes to the surface of the Sun were recorded. Research by the The Space and Science Research Center in Florida revealed a strong link between low solar activity and seismic events. Scientists say that it could take up to 15 years for solar activity to return to normal with extreme weather and freezing temperatures continuing until 2035.

Orban says there is not only Muslim invaders in the mix of \"refugees,\" but also \u201ceconomic migrants\" seeking better lives for themselves. Indeed, both of these are true. There are plenty of these people who are simply happy to have a place to live after many were driven from their homes due to the US, Russia and other countries putting their noses where they didn't belong and funding, training and arming Islamic jihadis there. Then, there are those who clearly come to the country to Islamasize the country because they have an Islamic dominionist attitude borne of the teachings of the Koran and Muhammad . RT reports: Refugees in Europe are just \u201cMuslim invaders\u201d and economic migrants seeking better lives, Hungarian PM Viktor Orban has said, adding that the large number of Muslims in the EU had led to the appearance of \u2018parallel societies.\u2019 Asked in an interview with the German Bild newspaper why Budapest does not want to accept any refugees, Orban replied: \u201cWe don\u2019t consider these people to be Muslim refugees.\u201d Instead, the tough-talking politician said they were regarded as \u201cMuslim invaders.\u201d Asylum seekers must cross four countries to reach Hungary from Syria, all of which are not as rich as Germany but are economically stable, the PM said. He was apparently referring to Turkey, Greece, Macedonia and Serbia \u2013 a common route for migrants heading for \u2018wealthy\u2019 Europe. \u201cSo, they are not running for their lives [in these countries]. They are merely economic migrants seeking a better life,\u201d Orban concluded. He stressed though, that he can only speak for the Hungarians and they \u201cdon\u2019t want\u201d immigration. In his view, the government simply can\u2019t go against the will of the people. And Orban has stayed the course, too while governments like that of Germany have ignored their people to allow for a clear invasion of Germany that has led to untold numbers of sexual assaults by Muslim migrants, attacks on Christians and there's no telling the amount of damage to the unethical welfare system in the country. RT continues: Going further, the prime minister noted that no refugee wants to go to Portugal, for example, adding that the majority of asylum seekers simply wanted to live in prosperous Germany. \u201cThe reason why people are in your country is not because they are refugees, but because they want a German life,\u201d he said, describing the issue \u201cpolitically\u201d as a European problem but, \u201csociologically,\u201d as a German problem. Orban specifically targeted Germany and Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s \u2018open-door\u2019 policy towards asylum seekers. \u201cI\u2019ve never understood how chaos, anarchy and illegal border crossings are viewed as something good in a country like Germany, which we view as the best example of discipline and the rule of law,\u201d he said. The recent wave of refugees reaching Europe is merely an invasion, according to Orban. \u201cIf someone wants to come to your house, he knocks on your door and asks: \u2018Can we come in, can we stay?\u2019 They [asylum seekers] didn\u2019t do that, they crossed the border illegally,\u201d he stated. Orban then did what most political representatives will simply not do, he told the truth about multiculturalism. He called it an \"illusion\" and said that Christian and Muslim societies \u201cwill never unite.\u201d Of course, they won't. They have absolutely nothing in common. They cannot agree on God's law, which most Western societies were base on, including the united States. They cannot agree on the Scriptures. They cannot agree on the person and work of Jesus the Christ. They can't even agree on the means of proselytizing and of what real spiritual weapons are. PM Orban has remained consistent. He has publicly told the Muslim invaders to leave Hungary and never come back. He has rebuffed Brussels, which is largely Islamic, and told them that Hungary would defend its borders, and it has. Orban's border wall reduced illegal immigration by 99%! He has genuinely reached out his hand to help Christian migrants instead of Muslim migrants and he seems to be one that holds to the Christian faith, as emulated by the Protestant Reformers, saying, \"That which serves the glory of God is the best for the people.\" Furthermore, Orban has also called out the man behind the curtain in a lot of the promoting of this Muslim invasion of the West, George Soros. Anti-jihadist activist Pamela Geller praised Orban for his honesty and wrote, \"At last, a politician who speaks the truth about the Muslim invasion of Europe. And while Orban is right that these are 'economic migrants,' they are also 'Muslim invaders.'\" \"They don\u2019t want a 'German life' in Germany in the sense that they are willing to accept German values,\" she added. \"Many, all too many, of them want to overwhelm German values, and European values in general, with sharia values. They are in Europe to conquer and Islamize it, with willing and eager help from Europe\u2019s short-sighted, self-serving, internationalist intelligentsia.\" Indeed! Thank you Prime Minister Orban for saying what needed to be said!\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

CNN responded by suing the White House, claiming that Acosta\u2019s due process and free speech rights were being infringed. Last week, a federal judge ordered the pass temporarily restored on due process grounds. In response to the letter, CNN dropped the lawsuit. Mainstream media outlets that had joined CNN in suing Trump celebrated Monday\u2019s letter, framing it as the White House \u201cbacking down\u201d in face of the legal challenge while largely ignoring the implications of the new rules: that the media critical of Trump might have won a battle, but lost the war.

Bishop Fischer is the tenth prelate to sign the profession. As has been widely reported, three bishops in Kazakhstan \u2013 Tomash Peta, Jan Pawel Lenga, and Athanasius Schneider \u2013 issued a Profession of the Immutable Truths about Sacramental Marriage on Dec. 31, 2017. The profession was made public on Jan. 2, 2018. In the document, the three bishops solemnly professed the Church\u2019s received teaching and discipline regarding sacramental marriage and the limited conditions (see Familiaris Consortio, n. 84) under which Catholics who are civilly divorced and joined in a second union may receive sacramental absolution and Holy Communion. Ordained to the priesthood in 1961, Fischer headed the Marriage and Family Centre of the Feldkirch diocese from 1979 to 1990. After serving as vicar general of the diocese from 1989, in 2005 Pope Benedict XVI appointed him bishop of Felkirch where he served until 2011, retiring at the age of 75. Bishop Fischer\u2019s support of the profession comes one week after Bishop Athanasius Schneider, auxiliary of Astana, Kazakstan, invited the world\u2019s bishops to sign the document and join in raising a common voice in defense of the sanctity and the indissolubility of marriage. \u201cGod decides the time, and the time will come when the Pope and the episcopacy again will proclaim, with all clarity, unambiguity and beauty, the sanctity of marriage, and of the family, and of the Eucharist,\u201d Schneider told LifesiteNews in an exclusive Jan. 15 interview. Schneider said greater public support of the document from the world\u2019s 5,000 bishops would be \u201ca stronger voice for professing the constant truths of the Church, and it would be a beautiful common voice defending the sanctity and the indissolubility of marriage in the midst of a real neo-pagan society where divorce has become a plague and where sexual depravity is increasingly spreading.\u201d Bishop Fischer\u2019s public support of the Profession of Immutable Truths about Sacramental Marriage brings the number of signatories to nine bishops and one cardinal. To date, in addition to the three original signatories from Kazakstan, the following prelates have signed the profession: \u2022 Cardinal Janis Pujats, Emeritus Archbishop Metropolitan of Riga, Latvia \u2022 Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigan\u00f2 of Italy and former apostolic nuncio to the United States \u2022 His Excellency Luigi Negri, Archbishop emeritus of Ferrara-Comacchio, Italy \u2022 Bishop Andreas Laun, Emeritus Auxiliary of Salzburg, Austria \u2022 His Excellency Rene Gracida, Bishop emeritus of Corpus Christi, Texas, USA \u2022 His Excellency Marian Eleganti, auxiliary bishop of Chur, Switzerland \u2022 His Excellency Elmar Fischer, Bishop emeritus of Feldkirch, Austria.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

            "question": "Which of the following tactics is used in the following text?\n\nArticle: Asteroid Will Skim By Earth Days Before Christmas: It Is \u2018Potentially Hazardous\u2019 An asteroid called 3200 Phaethon will skim past the Earth just days before many will celebrate with Christmas festivities. The three-mile-wide asteroid is expected to miss the Earth, but it\u2019s still labeled as \u201cpotentially hazardous,\u201d and for good reasons. With a diameter of about 3 miles, the asteroid named 3200 Phaethon (after the Greek demi-god who, according to legend, nearly set the Earth on fire) is classified as \u201cpotentially hazardous\u201d by the Minor Planet Center. The asteroid will pass within 6.5 million miles of the Earth, which is relatively close in space terms, but still around 27 times the distance of the moon. Much closer flybys have occurred in the very recent past. Scientists at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory are planning to use the opportunity to obtain a detailed 3D model of the asteroid, which has a particularly irregular shape. First detected in December 2007, 3200 Phaethon is widely thought to be the parent body for the Geminid meteor shower, which is due to peak this year on the night of December 13. This would make the Geminids one of only two major meteor showers not originating from a comet; the other being the Quadrantids in January. The main difference between asteroids and comets is their composition. Asteroids are made up of metals and rocky material, while comets are made up of ice, dust and rocky material. Comets which approach the Sun lose material with each orbit because some of their ice melts and vaporizes to form a tail. But the real question is will anyone be able to see the asteroid\u2019s close approach to our planet. According to NASA, 3200 Phaethon will be visible in small telescopes for experienced observers in areas with dark skies. It is potentially detectable for three weeks but will be at its brightest between December 11 and 21. If you don\u2019t see the asteroid itself, be sure to look out for the Geminid meteor shower, which is set to provide a spectacular show over the course of 10 nights in December, with as many as 100 shooting stars every hour.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

            "question": "Which of the following tactics is used in the following text?\n\nArticle: Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange It is welcome that finally there has been a little pushback, including from leading journalists, to the Guardian\u2019s long-running vilification of Julian Assange, the founder of Wikileaks. Reporter Luke Harding\u2019s latest article, claiming that Donald Trump\u2019s disgraced former campaign manager Paul Manafort secretly visited Assange in Ecuador\u2019s embassy in London on three occasions, is so full of holes that even hardened opponents of Assange in the corporate media are struggling to stand by it. Faced with the backlash, the Guardian quickly \u2013 and very quietly \u2013 rowed back its initial certainty that its story was based on verified facts. Instead, it amended the text, without acknowledging it had done so, to attribute the claims to unnamed, and uncheckable, \u201csources\u201d. The propaganda function of the piece is patent. It is intended to provide evidence for long-standing allegations that Assange conspired with Trump, and Trump\u2019s supposed backers in the Kremlin, to damage Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential race. The Guardian\u2019s latest story provides a supposedly stronger foundation for an existing narrative: that Assange and Wikileaks knowingly published emails hacked by Russia from the Democratic party\u2019s servers. In truth, there is no public evidence that the emails were hacked, or that Russia was involved. Central actors have suggested instead that the emails were leaked from within the Democratic party. Nonetheless, this unverified allegation has been aggressively exploited by the Democratic leadership because it shifts attention away both from its failure to mount an effective electoral challenge to Trump and from the damaging contents of the emails. These show that party bureaucrats sought to rig the primaries to make sure Clinton\u2019s challenger for the Democratic nomination, Bernie Sanders, lost. To underscore the intended effect of the Guardian\u2019s new claims, Harding even throws in a casual and unsubstantiated reference to \u201cRussians\u201d joining Manafort in supposedly meeting Assange. Manafort has denied the Guardian\u2019s claims, while Assange has threatened to sue the Guardian for libel. \u2018Responsible for Trump\u2019 The emotional impact of the Guardian story is to suggest that Assange is responsible for four years or more of Trump rule. But more significantly, it bolsters the otherwise risible claim that Assange is not a publisher \u2013 and thereby entitled to the protections of a free press, as enjoyed by the Guardian or the New York Times \u2013 but the head of an organisation engaged in espionage for a foreign power. The intention is to deeply discredit Assange, and by extension the Wikileaks organisation, in the eyes of right-thinking liberals. That, in turn, will make it much easier to silence Assange and the vital cause he represents: the use of new media to hold to account the old, corporate media and political elites through the imposition of far greater transparency. The Guardian story will prepare public opinion for the moment when Ecuador\u2019s rightwing government under President Lenin Moreno forces Assange out of the embassy, having already withdrawn most of his rights to use digital media. It will soften opposition when the UK moves to arrest Assange on self-serving bail violation charges and extradites him to the US. And it will pave the way for the US legal system to lock Assange up for a very long time. For the best part of a decade, any claims by Assange\u2019s supporters that avoiding this fate was the reason Assange originally sought asylum in the embassy was ridiculed by corporate journalists, not least at the Guardian. Even when a United Nations panel of experts in international law ruled in 2016 that Assange was being arbitrarily \u2013 and unlawfully \u2013 detained by the UK, Guardian writers led efforts to discredit the UN report. See here and here. Now Assange and his supporters have been proved right once again. An administrative error this month revealed that the US justice department had secretly filed criminal charges against Assange. Heavy surveillance The problem for the Guardian, which should have been obvious to its editors from the outset, is that any visits by Manafort would be easily verifiable without relying on unnamed \u201csources\u201d. Glenn Greenwald is far from alone in noting that London is possibly the most surveilled city in the world, with CCTV cameras everywhere. The environs of the Ecuadorian embassy are monitored especially heavily, with continuous filming by the UK and Ecuadorian authorities and most likely by the US and other actors with an interest in Assange\u2019s fate. The idea that Manafort or \u201cRussians\u201d could have wandered into the embassy to meet Assange even once without their trail, entry and meeting being intimately scrutinised and recorded is simply preposterous. According to Greenwald: \u201cIf Paul Manafort \u2026 visited Assange at the Embassy, there would be ample amounts of video and other photographic proof demonstrating that this happened. The Guardian provides none of that.\u201d Former British ambassador Craig Murray also points out the extensive security checks insisted on by the embassy to which any visitor to Assange must submit. Any visits by Manafort would have been logged. In fact, the Guardian obtained the embassy\u2019s logs in May, and has never made any mention of either Manafort or \u201cRussians\u201d being identified in them. It did not refer to the logs in its latest story. Murray: The problem with this latest fabrication is that [Ecuador\u2019s President] Moreno had already released the visitor logs to the Mueller inquiry. Neither Manafort nor these \u201cRussians\u201d are in the visitor logs \u2026 What possible motive would the Ecuadorean government have for facilitating secret unrecorded visits by Paul Manafort? Furthermore it is impossible that the intelligence agency \u2013 who were in charge of the security \u2013 would not know the identity of these alleged \u201cRussians\u201d. No fact-checking It is worth noting it should be vitally important for a serious publication like the Guardian to ensure its claims are unassailably true \u2013 both because Assange\u2019s personal fate rests on their veracity, and because, even more importantly, a fundamental right, the freedom of the press, is\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

That\u2019s the nexus of a letter allegedly acquired by Democrat Senator Dianne Feinstein in July but dropped on the last days before the vote for Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation. The unidentified woman says the incident took place at a party in the early 1980s while Kavanaugh was a student at Georgetown Preparatory School in Bethesda, Md., according to the NYDN, which claims to have obtained the letter on Friday. She alleges Kavanaugh and a friend of his, both of whom had been drinking, cornered her in a room and turned up the music to blur out the sound of her protests. Kavanaugh then allegedly covered the woman\u2019s mouth with his hand and attempted to force himself on her, but she says she managed to free herself and bolt out of the room. Kavanaugh, 53, vehemently denied the woman\u2019s allegations. \u201cI categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cI did not do this back in high school or at any time.\u201d Kavanaugh\u2019s friend, who has not been identified, did not outright deny the woman\u2019s claims but told the New Yorker he has \u201cno recollection of that.\u201d The woman says she has had to undergo psychological treatment as a result of the incident. She first approached her congresswoman, Anna Eshoo, D-Calif., about the allegations in July shortly after Trump tapped Kavanaugh to replace outgoing Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. Eshoo\u2019s office declined to comment. The woman\u2019s letter was in turn forwarded to Feinstein, D-Calif., who shared it with the FBI and her Democratic committee colleagues on Wednesday night. An FBI official told the New York Daily News on Thursday that the letter has not yet resulted in a criminal investigation. According to Breitbart, on Friday, 65 women from both the Republican and Democrat parties who have known Kavanaugh since high school defended his character and said he has always behaved \u201chonorably\u201d and treaded \u201cwomen with respect.\u201d The women also said that Kavanaugh has \u201cstood out for his friendship, character, and integrity.\u201d \u201cJudge Kavanaugh has denied this allegation and over 60 women \u2013 with a broad range of political views \u2013 who\u2019ve known him since high school, have sent a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee vouching for his integrity and respect for women over that time,\u201d says Carrie Severino, chief counsel for the Judicial Crisis Network. \u201cThis is nothing more than a last-minute attempt at character assassination, and there should no delay in confirming Judge Kavanaugh.\u201d\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

The FBI arrested Imran, the eldest of the three Awan brothers, at Dulles Airport trying to fly to Pakistan in July, and prosecutors charged him with fraudulently gathering money the prior winter to wire overseas, possibly in an attempt to flee the investigation into the family\u2019s activities involving House computers. \u201cBased on the suspicious timing of that transaction, Awan and [wife Hina] Alvi likely knew they were under investigation at that time\u201d and \u201cthere are strong indications of flight in this case,\u201d prosecutors wrote. Abid was making his own efforts to round up money at the same time via the life insurance policy. On Nov. 16, 2016, the brothers made a video of his bedridden father signing over ownership \u2014 but not changing the beneficiary \u2014 of his life insurance policy to Abid. Abid then used those rights to replace Gilani with himself as beneficiary. When his father died on Jan. 16, 2017, the youngest Awan brother, Jamal, attested on the death certificate provided to the insurance company that his father was divorced, a statement Gilani\u2019s lawyer said would have kept her from the money. A Virginia court later ruled that Jamal\u2019s statement about his marital status on the certificate was wrong. \u201cWhy is that even relevant?\u201d Bacon said of Jamal\u2019s misstatement at the March 7 court date. On Dec. 12, 2016, Imran and Alvi \u2013 who was also on the House payroll \u2013 began taking a series of withdrawals from banks, some of which federal prosecutors say occurred under fraudulent pretenses. In January 2017, Imran wired nearly $300,000 to Pakistan. Imran wired nearly $300,000 to Pakistan Jan. 18, according to the indictment. On Jan. 17, Abid filed notarized papers using those rights to replace Gilani with himself as beneficiary. The life insurance change\u2019s timing seems to coincide with other moves by Abid to liquidate property and transfer it. Ten weeks prior, on Nov. 1, 2016, Alvi sold a house to Jamal for $620,000, netting another significant profit from the mortgage company. In addition to his primary residence, Abid owned the house where his mother and stepfather lived, and moved in after his death, with Gilani becoming homeless. Abid owned two homes despite a $1 million 2012 bankruptcy that might ordinarily have forced him to sell the second home to pay creditors. At that time, he filed forms \u201cunder penalty of perjury\u201d that two houses were needed as \u201cmy spouse and I are legally separated under applicable non-bankruptcy law or my spouse and I are living apart other than for the purposes of evading the requirements.\u201d However, his wife, Ukrainian-born Nataliia Sova \u2013 who also was on the House payroll \u2013 signed as a witness on the 2016 life insurance form as \u201cspouse of Abid,\u201d and they have been photographed living together. Gilani told TheDCNF the brothers were trying to use the life insurance policy as leverage to persuade her to sign a power of attorney giving them access to \u201cassets of my late husband in Pakistan,\u201d which were much more valuable than the $50,000 policy. Americo, the life insurance company, said there was \u201cgreat doubt\u201d about who the rightful policy holder was, given the allegations of fraud, and sent the decision to the courts to sort out on April 14, two months after the House sargent-at-arms banned the Awans for \u201csuspicious activity.\u201d Gilani alleged the brothers took her financial documents, a laptop, and her husband\u2019s possessions. The only lawyer she could afford, she claimed, was Michael Hadeed, a business attorney who was convicted in 2010 of conspiracy and immigration fraud for helping aliens obtain green cards by setting them up with fake employment relationships. He lost his bar license for two years, according to Virginia State Bar documents. Hadeed did not introduce any evidence to the judge about a pattern of possible fraud by Abid, the timing of the move\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

From the pulpits in America today we here the events unfold of Sodom and Gomorra and how Abraham should have prayed longer in hopes that God would have spared them rather than the righteous people in Sodom and Gomorra doing what God had commanded. And of course, not a second thought on man's behalf is given concerning the victims in these two cities. Here is Abraham\u2019s account\u2026 \u201cAnd the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way. And the Lord said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do; Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him? For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord, to do justice and judgment; that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him. And the Lord said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous; I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know. And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the Lord. And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked? Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein? That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right? And the Lord said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes. And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, which am but dust and ashes: Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it. And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake. And he said unto him, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there. And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto theLord: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for twenty's sake. And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for ten's sake. And the Lord went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.\" -Genesis 18:16-33 Got questions.org explains very well\u2026 Genesis chapter 19 records the two angels, disguised as human men, visiting Sodom and Gomorrah. Lot met the angels in the city square and urged them to stay at his house. The angels agreed. The Bible then informs us, \"Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom \u2014 both young and old \u2014 surrounded the house. They called to Lot, 'Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them. Genesis 19:4-5 The angels then proceed to blind all the men of Sodom and Gomorrah and urge Lot and his family to flee from the cities to escape the wrath that God was about to deliver. Lot and his family flee the city, and then \"the LORD rained down burning sulfur on Sodom and Gomorrah \u2014 from the LORD out of the heavens. Thus he overthrew those cities and the entire plain, including all those living in the cities...\" (Genesis 19:2 4) .

And outside it. While the 69-year-old Jewish man (wearing a kippah on his head) was coming out of the synagogue, heading for a bakery near 17 rue Pelleport in Paris 20 th, he was attacked by a 19-year-old man, of North African descent, who hit him on the body and on the head, knocked down, pulled by the hair and beaten while shouting \"Allah Akbar\". Long live Hitler, to death the Jews. \" It can't be a case of Muslim Judeophobia. (That would be Islamophobic.) And since we're in Europe, it's time to default to the standard excuse, mental illness, current flavor, over-excitement. The police quickly intervened to save the victim who lodged a complaint. The anti-Semitic attacker was arrested and placed in police custody and then transferred to the psychiatric infirmary, on the recommendation of the doctor because of his observed state of excitement. It's okay. Getting really excited about Jews is a common problem among Muslim settlers in France. Earlier this month, the suspect in the alleged murder of a Jewish physician in Paris was deemed not responsible for his actions in a second psychiatric evaluation ordered by a judge even though the defense did not request it. The suspect, Traore Kobili, is scheduled to have a third evaluation to determine his ability to stand trial for the murder of Sarah Halimi in April 2017. He is alleged to have beaten her to death while calling her a demon and shouting about Allah before throwing her body from the window of her third-story apartment. They're all crazy in Europe. A Muslim terrorist stabbed four people at a train station near Munich while screaming, \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d. In between proclaiming the glory of Allah, he also shouted that his victims were all \u201cunbelievers\u201d. A woman heard him say, \u201cInfidel, you must die\u201d. The German authorities came to the inescapable conclusion that the attack had nothing to do with Islam. Instead the Muslim terrorist had been \u201cmentally ill\u201d and was probably not even fit to stand trial. And in Russia. Gyulchekhra Bobokulova beheaded a 4-year-old girl and displayed her head in the street while shouting, \u201cAllahu Akbar. I hate democracy. I am a terrorist. I want you dead.\u201d Faced with these bafflingly inscrutable statements, the authorities blamed mental illness. And Amsterdam. In May, Malek, a Syrian refugee, stabbed three people in The Hague while shouting, \u201cAllahu Akbar.\u201d The Syrian had previously thanked the Dutch people for their hospitality by shouting, \u201cAllahu Akbar,\u201d and throwing pieces of furniture out of the window of his apartment and into the street. On the loose, Malek cut a man\u2019s throat. He also stabbed two others. Police shot him in the leg, ruled out terrorism and blamed mental illness. In December of last year, Saleh Ali, a Syrian refugee wearing a keffiyah and waving a terrorist PLO flag, went up to a Jewish restaurant in Amsterdam, shouted \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d and began smashing the windows. The police stood by and watched until he was done. And then they arrested him. Ali admitted to having fought with Jihadists in Syria. So the system decided that he needed a psychiatric evaluation Maybe it's not the terrorists who are nuts. Maybe it's the authorities who are insane.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

Dina Powell is the swamp. You can see her out there at the Clinton Global Initiative, next to Samantha Power, palling around with Valerie Jarrett or Huma Abedin. Dina Habib Powell was an influential figure in the Bush administration. The Egyptian-American immigrant had served as a gatekeeper for George W. Bush. If you wanted a job, you went through her. Barely 30, Habib Powell had more power than many of the big Bush era names you do know. Then she took on the mission of promoting America to the Muslim world at the State Department. There were cultural exchanges with Iran and money for Lebanon and the Palestinian Authority. Afterward it was off to make millions through philanthropy at the Goldman Sachs Foundation. Habib Powell had all the right friends. Like Valerie Jarrett. Arianna Huffington praised the White House for bringing her in. Her ex-husband heads up Teneo Strategy: the organization created by the same man who made the Clinton Foundation happen and which employed Huma Abedin. You could see her posing next to Huma, Arianna and a Saudi princess. You can see her photographed at the American Task Force of Palestine gala. The ATFP was originally Rashid Khalidi\u2019s American Committee on Jerusalem. Khalidi was the former PLO spokesman at the center of the Obama tape scandal. And Habib Powell was there as a presenter at the Middle East Institute after a speech by the PLO\u2019s Hanan Ashrawi. Unlike McFarland, Habib Powell had no national security background. But though her parents were Christians, she had the \u201cright\u201d views on Islam. In Egypt, she had described how Bush after September 11 had, \u201cvisited a mosque, took off his shoes and paid his respects.\u201d \"I see the president talk of Islam as a religion of peace, I see him host an iftar every year.\u201d Habib Powell had attended such an iftar dinner. Habib Powell has been described as the Republican Huma Abedin. And she was quoted as saying that Abedin \u201cfeels a deep responsibility to encourage more mutual understanding between her beliefs and culture and American culture.\u201d And Powell has been on cheerful terms with at least one Obama unmasker. And with Clintonworld people. In 2015, Dina Powell \u2013 President Donald Trump\u2019s Deputy National Security Adviser in 2017 \u2013 sat down with far left-wing United Nations Ambassador Samantha Power for an interview. In that interview, Powell heaped effusive praise upon Power and can be seen nodding in agreement throughout. Power was a senior adviser to President Barack Obama. At the time, Powell \u2013 an executive with Goldman Sachs \u2013 was pushing a pet project known as 10,000 women, which is ostensibly intended to foster female entrepreneurship. When Powell was at Goldman Sachs, her right-hand woman in the 10,000 Women program was Noa Meyer. Perhaps not so coincidentally, Meyer worked in the Bill Clinton administration\u2019s speech-writing office of then first-lady Hillary Clinton. Powell herself, is very comfortable with Hillary Clinton. In 2013, she shared a stage with Hillary at the Clinton Global Initiative. In 2007, Powell was named to the Board of a Hillary Clinton project known as \u2018Vital Voices\u2019,another women-centric operation that touts Global Ambassadorial missions for women. On June 14, 2016 Powell participated in a Summit known as the United State of Women(USW), which meshed nicely with her pet project. USW was also rife with angry left-wing Democrats seeking to get Hillary Clinton elected in 2016. In fact, Barack Obama\u2019s closest adviser Valerie Jarrett introduced Powell, who returned the introduction with effusive praise for Jarrett. The ex-Goldman Sachs executive has befriended Obama\u2019s closest adviser, Valerie Jarrett. She is also very cozy with Hillary Clinton\u2019s closest advisers Huma Abedin and Philippe Reines. Now there's once again talk of moving Dina Powell in. This time into Nikki Halley's old spot as UN Ambassador. The talk comes from the GOP establishment. Powell should not be at the NSC, where she replaced K.T. McFarland, who was qualified for the job, at the behest of H.R. McMaster. But every job for Powell is a stepping stone to the next one. And the one she has her eyes on now would be an even bigger disaster. Making Dina Powell the US Ambassador to the UN would quickly undo all the progress that Haley made. Before long the US would be right back in the Human Rights Council, there would be moves in favor of the PLO, and the same old failed politics would be back. Haley sent a message that UN members will be punished if they push the US around. Powell would swiftly undo that. Dina Powell would have been a Jeb Bush appointee. Appointing her to the UN would give Trump, Jeb Bush's policies. You don't drain the swamp by appointing the swamp. And Powell is one of the worst swamp creatures in D.C.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

            "question": "Which of the following tactics is used in the following text?\n\nArticle: Kavanaugh Nomination Is Exploding in Trump\u2019s Face The president is doubling down on an increasingly risky candidate. Justice Anthony Kennedy gave President Donald Trump the biggest political gift possible when he announced his resignation in the spring. Even though not everything that\u2019s gone wrong is Trump\u2019s fault, he has managed to make a complete hash of Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination to fill the empty seat on the court. It\u2019s a good example of how badly Trump does his job more than a year and a half into his administration. To begin with, Trump has outsourced his judicial nominations to outside, party-aligned groups, the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society. That included an unusually central role for the Federalist Society\u2019s Leonard Leo. That wasn\u2019t entirely a Trump mistake. His decision during the campaign to release a list of potential justices drafted by Leo reflected the reality-TV star\u2019s weakness as a presidential candidate. The party was worried that Trump might turn out not to be a conservative; to reassure them, he publicly committed to their top goal. In some ways, that\u2019s successful coalition-building, and what he\u2019s done in office is just keeping his promises on judges. Still, it\u2019s one thing to form an alliance with conservatives; it\u2019s another to turn the whole process over to them. We don\u2019t know to what extent Kavanaugh was Trump\u2019s choice and to what extent he was manipulated into choosing him. We have plenty of evidence that Trump is easily manipulated by those around him, and that Kavanaugh is a good fit for Trump\u2019s biases: The judge has Ivy League credentials and he passes Trump\u2019s cut-of-his-jib test by looking the part. 1 Either way, Kavanaugh was a poor choice from the point of view of good presidenting. The judge was certain to be a highly controversial selection from the start. After all, he had been a highly controversial selection for his current circuit court seat, eventually getting confirmed with only four Democratic votes after a long delay. Kavanaugh is a longtime Republican operative, a hard-liner during both the Vince Foster and Monica Lewinsky investigations. Nominating him, rather than a conservative with similar views but a different background, was bound to stir up trouble. It was also true, as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell reportedly warned, that normal disclosure of Kavanaugh\u2019s record, especially his service during the George W. Bush administration, was going to delay confirmation even more. Senate Republicans dealt with that problem by deciding to not bother with any Kavanaugh documents that couldn\u2019t be produced rapidly, which further riled up the Democrats and gave that party some good talking points. 2 Sometimes it\u2019s worth taking risks. Presidents who shy away from anything that\u2019s not a sure thing can fail to exploit opportunities. It\u2019s just very hard to see any upside for Trump in choosing Kavanaugh instead of a safer, but still very conservative, other option. 3 When serious charges of sexual misconduct were raised against Kavanaugh, Trump decided to stick with him instead of moving on to another candidate. It\u2019s still not clear that Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination is doomed, but it\u2019s certainly in severe trouble. Losing a high-profile fight is always going to hurt a president, which is why they should take care to avoid high-risk, low-reward conflicts. But there\u2019s an art to minimizing damage. And Trump hasn\u2019t learned it yet. For one thing, the president has made this an extremely high-profile episode by stringing out the process as the accusations against Kavanaugh gained credibility and even multiplied. Whether that matters in terms of public opinion for Trump is unclear, but it certainly isn\u2019t good for any Republican senators caught up in the middle, along with any other candidates who have had to weigh in only to find the facts as they knew them constantly changing. It\u2019s also the case that the more negative information comes out, the more it appears that the Trump and his White House staff failed to do their jobs in vetting and managing Kavanaugh. If the nomination had been pulled right after Christine Blasey Ford made her initial assertions about Kavanaugh, the public might have concluded that it wasn\u2019t Trump\u2019s fault that a previously unaired accusation came to light. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s behavior has been as erratic as ever. First he said that Brasey had to be heard; then he attacked her in terms that were a slur on all women who have been assaulted without immediately reporting it to the police, and he also blamed the Senate for not voting before she came forward. He sometimes praises Kavanaugh, but also let it be known that he thought the nominee had performed badly in his Fox News interview. The White House demanded a final up and down vote on Tuesday; by Wednesday, he was saying that the nomination would die if Kavanaugh didn\u2019t do well before the Judiciary Committee on Thursday. The sum of all this has been, as in many other episodes, that Trump and his White House are a gang that can\u2019t shoot straight and that he\u2019s eager to blame his allies and lash out at his enemies in ugly ways when things go wrong. A botched nomination matters because allies will be less likely to trust Trump, not just on Supreme Court choices, but on any initiative. And, for that matter, they\u2019ll be less likely to trust him when he asserts that there\u2019s nothing remaining for Special Counsel Robert Mueller to reveal. Trump\u2019s professional reputation is already terrible, but everything counts. As the political scientist Richard Neustadt said, political elites are constantly evaluating and re-evaluating the president. Trump is hurting himself right now, and will have hurt himself more if Kavanaugh is not confirmed. And yes, I call it the cut-of-his-jib test quite deliberately. It's no surprise that someone who hires based on what he thinks someone doing that job should look like, which seems to be based on hazy old-time Hollywood casting, would wind up with fewer women in\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

Luke Harding and the Guardian Publish Still More Blatant MI6 Lies The right wing Ecuadorean government of President Moreno continues to churn out its production line of fake documents regarding Julian Assange, and channel them straight to MI6 mouthpiece Luke Harding of the Guardian. Amazingly, more Ecuadorean Government documents have just been discovered for the Guardian, this time spy agency reports detailing visits of Paul Manafort and unspecified \u201cRussians\u201d to the Embassy. By a wonderful coincidence of timing, this is the day after Mueller announced that Manafort\u2019s plea deal was over. The problem with this latest fabrication is that Moreno had already released the visitor logs to the Mueller inquiry. Neither Manafort nor these \u201cRussians\u201d are in the visitor logs. This is impossible. The visitor logs were not kept by Wikileaks, but by the very strict Ecuadorean security. Nobody was ever admitted without being entered in the logs. The procedure was very thorough. To go in, you had to submit your passport (no other type of document was accepted). A copy of your passport was taken and the passport details entered into the log. Your passport, along with your mobile phone and any other electronic equipment, was retained until you left, along with your bag and coat. I feature in the logs every time I visited. There were no exceptions. For an exception to be made for Manafort and the \u201cRussians\u201d would have had to be a decision of the Government of Ecuador, not of Wikileaks, and that would be so exceptional the reason for it would surely have been noted in the now leaked supposed Ecuadorean \u201cintelligence report\u201d of the visits. What possible motive would the Ecuadorean government have for facilitating secret unrecorded visits by Paul Manafort? Furthermore it is impossible that the intelligence agency \u2013 who were in charge of the security \u2013 would not know the identity of these alleged \u201cRussians\u201d. Previously Harding and the Guardian have published documents faked by the Moreno government regarding a diplomatic appointment to Russia for Assange of which he had no knowledge. Now they follow this up with more documents aimed to provide fictitious evidence to bolster Mueller\u2019s pathetically failed attempt to substantiate the story that Russia deprived Hillary of the Presidency. My friend William Binney, probably the world\u2019s greatest expert on electronic surveillance, former Technical Director of the NSA, has stated that it is impossible the DNC servers were hacked, the technical evidence shows it was a download to a directly connected memory stick. I knew the US security services were conducting a fake investigation the moment it became clear that the FBI did not even themselves look at the DNC servers, instead accepting a report from the Clinton linked DNC \u201csecurity consultants\u201d Crowdstrike. I would love to believe that the fact Julian has never met Manafort is bound to be established. But I fear that state control of propaganda may be such that this massive \u201cBig Lie\u201d will come to enter public consciousness in the same way as the non-existent Russian hack of the DNC servers. Assange never met Manafort. The DNC emails were downloaded by an insider. Assange never even considered fleeing to Russia. Those are the facts, and I am in a position to give you a personal assurance of them. I can also assure you that Luke Harding, the Guardian, Washington Post and New York Times have been publishing a stream of deliberate lies, in collusion with the security services. I am not a fan of Donald Trump. But to see the partisans of the defeated candidate (and a particularly obnoxious defeated candidate) manipulate the security services and the media to create an entirely false public perception, in order to attempt to overturn the result of the US Presidential election, is the most astonishing thing I have witnessed in my lifetime. Plainly the government of Ecuador is releasing lies about Assange to curry favour with the security establishment of the USA and UK, and to damage Assange\u2019s support prior to expelling him from the Embassy. He will then be extradited from London to the USA on charges of espionage. Assange is not a whistleblower or a spy \u2013 he is the greatest publisher of his age, and has done more to bring the crimes of governments to light than the mainstream media will ever be motivated to achieve. That supposedly great newspaper titles like the Guardian, New York Times and Washington Post are involved in the spreading of lies to damage Assange, and are seeking his imprisonment for publishing state secrets, is clear evidence that the idea of the \u201cliberal media\u201d no longer exists in the new plutocratic age. The press are not on the side of the people, they are an instrument of elite control.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

Later that year, Shivam Patel, 28, tried to join the U.S. Army and Air Force. And in the application process, he lied to military recruiters about a recent trip he'd taken to Jordan in a failed attempt to make contact with the Islamic State and join a \"real Muslim Army,\" the documents said. Patel pleaded guilty Thursday in U.S. District Court to two counts of making false statements. He faces up to 15 years in prison when sentenced June 4. According to court documents and prosecutors, Patel \u2013 who was raised Hindu before converting to Islam several years ago \u2013 traveled to China in July 2016 to teach English. While there, however, he grew displeased with how that country treated Muslims. His employer arranged for Patel to fly back to Virginia on Aug. 23, 2016, but instead Patel chose to travel to Jordan, a statement of facts filed with his plea agreement said. Jordanian officials arrested Patel a few days later. It's unclear why, but court documents say Patel told taxi drivers and others in Jordan that he supported the Islamic State. A search of Patel's computer also showed he researched how to join the Islamic State before he left for China. Jordanian officials moved for Patel's deportation. On Sept. 2, 2016, he boarded a flight to Chicago, and the next day, he flew to Detroit. There, he met an FBI source and started talking about the Islamic State. He explained he went to Jordan in part to find like-minded Muslims, and because he wanted to do something \u201cbigger, better, and more purposeful\u201d \u2013 like dying in the cause of Allah. But, he said, he was afraid of making his parents sad. In the course of their conversations, Patel discussed his desire to see a holy war between Muslims and non-Muslims. He also sang an Islamic State fight song and recalled making a replica of the group\u2019s flag. He said he wanted to replace his neighbor\u2019s American flag with it. Patel returned to Williamsburg on Sept. 6, 2016. Shortly thereafter, he moved into a motel his parents owned and started applying for jobs with the military, as well as some paramilitary organizations \u2013 like police and fire departments, correctional facilities and probation offices. While back in Virginia, Patel stayed in touch with the FBI source. He texted the source on Sept. 23, 2016, and expressed support for Maj. Nidal Hasan, who killed 13 soldiers in 2009 while serving at Fort Hood. In the process, however, he misidentified Hasan as Nidal Hussein and said the shooting happened at Fort Knox in Kentucky. He also said Hasan had died a martyr, though in fact he remains alive on military death row. Court documents show Patel began saying in late 2016 that he did not actually support the Islamic State. Simply expressing support for a terrorist organization or attack is not against the law. Patel's crime was failing to disclose his trips to Jordan when he was trying to join the Army and Air Force in December 2016 and January 2017. Court documents say Patel lied about his travel history, saying his only time out of the country in the past seven years was a family trip to India in 2011 and 2012. Before Patel signed the Army application, a recruiter asked him specifically about the travel question and reminded him providing false information could result in criminal charges. During the interview, the recruiter asked to see Patel's passport to confirm his travel claims. Patel agreed to bring it by, but two days later he told the State Department he had accidentally thrown it away in October and needed a new one. After Patel's arrest in July, investigators found his passport \"near\" the motel room where he was living, the documents said. \u00a92018 The Virginian-Pilot (Norfolk, Va.)

Americans still have no idea what happened in Las Vegas in October. And one lawmaker is hinting that the government is covering up a big story about terrorism. During an appearance with Tucker Carlson on Fox, Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) said he\u2019s seen credible evidence that ISIS was involved in the devastating Las Vegas shooting. ISIS terrorists, he said, infiltrated the U.S. via the southern border prior to the attack blamed on alleged lone gunman Stephen Paddock. \u201cRecently I have been made aware of what I believe to be credible evidence, credible information regarding potential terrorist infiltration through the southern border regarding this incident,\u201d Perry said. Perry added that ISIS warnings of a forthcoming attack on Las Vegas prior to the shooting make a terror link even more likely. \u201cWell, they could be\u2013lets face it, ISIS twice before the attack, ISIS warned the United States that they would attack Las Vegas in June and August after the attack claimed responsibility four times. Meanwhile, the local law enforcement investigative services are telling us there is no terrorist connection\u2013lone gunman, again, something is not adding up,\u201d Perry replied. An incredulous Carlson asked fellow guest Catherine Lombardo, a lawyer representing families affected by the tragedy, about the law enforcement investigation into the shooting. \u201cThe FBI and the Las Vegas metro police department have been conducting the investigation, \u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen no evidence of a terrorist attack, and I will ask with all due respect, congressman, unless have you specific evidence to back that up, it seems a bit irresponsible to make that allegation so, if you do, or make that assertion, if do you have any evidence of that, I\u2019m asking you right now to share it with us and tell us what that is.

            "question": "Which of the following tactics is used in the following text?\n\nArticle: Pope Francis' sexual abuse commission, hit by resignations and criticism, gets a reboot Last week Pope Francis announced he was reviving a panel he created to advise the Vatican on how to handle sexual abuse by clergy. The issue has dogged the Roman Catholic Church in recent years, and critics have accused Francis and his two predecessors, John Paul II and Benedict XVI, of failing to aggressively weed out and punish predator priests. Here\u2019s a look what drove the panel\u2019s creation and what to expect in the future. What is Pope Francis\u2019 commission on sexual abuse? Following criticism he was not focusing on halting child abuse within the church, Francis created the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors in March 2014, naming Cardinal Sean O\u2019Malley, the archbishop of Boston, to run it. O\u2019Malley was not only a member of the pope\u2019s \u201cG9\u201d group of close advisors; he was also the man who sought to clean up the abuse scandal in Boston after the departure of his predecessor, Cardinal Bernard Law, whose shifting of predator priests to new posts was exposed by the Boston Globe and chronicled in the movie \u201cSpotlight.\u201d The revelations about Law, who died in December, emboldened abuse victims across the country and world, who began speaking up about the priests who had molested them. When he created the commission, Francis said: \u201cThe commission\u2019s specific task is to propose to me the most opportune initiatives for protecting minors and vulnerable adults, in order that we may do everything possible to ensure that crimes such as those which have occurred are no longer repeated in the Church.\u201d Why is it being renewed now? After the commission\u2019s three-year mandate expired in December, Francis relaunched it on Feb. 17 with some members reappointed and nine new members added, some of whom are victims of abuse, although the Vatican declined to say which, opting to respect their privacy. O\u2019Malley returns as chief. New members come from Australia, Brazil, Ethiopia, India, the Netherlands and Tonga, \"reflecting the global reach of the church and the challenge of creating safeguarding structures in diverse cultural context,\u201d the Vatican said. What did the first commission achieve? The Vatican has said it \u201cworked with almost 200 dioceses and religious communities worldwide to raise awareness and to educate people on the need for safeguarding in our homes, parishes, schools, hospitals, and other institutions.\u201d What didn\u2019t it do? Commission members quickly realized they needed to go beyond raising awareness and deal with the bishops who quietly shift offenders to new dioceses when they are exposed as molesters and rapists. Even if church laws already existed to hold bishops accountable for their priests\u2019 behavior, those strictures were not enough, O\u2019Malley said in 2014. \u201cThere are, theoretically I guess, canons that could apply here, but obviously they have not been sufficient,\u201d he said. The commission was behind Francis\u2019 decision in 2015 to create a new tribunal to judge bishops caught covering up for abusive priests, and to fund it for five years. But amid myriad legal questions over what exact powers the court would have, it never got off the ground. In 2016, Francis officially killed the plan to create it, issuing a document that essentially called on using existing procedures to tackle the problem. Francis was also criticized when Australian Cardinal George Pell, whom he had brought to Rome to clean up Vatican finances, was forced to return to Australia last year to face charges of sexual assault. Any other problems? Commission members said bishops should call the police when they discovered predator priests, rather than phone the nearest religious retreat to \u201cpark\u201d the priest out of harm\u2019s way. But this simple message was hard to get across. It emerged that during a Vatican training course for new bishops in September 2015 a French priest informed bishops they had no obligation to report abuse to the police, forcing the commission to issue a strong statement saying bishops had every obligation to do so. Did commission members persevere? Not all of them. British member Peter Saunders, a former victim of priestly abuse, was ousted in 2016. He said the group was a toothless, paper-shuffling exercise. Irish member Marie Collins, another victim, resigned in March last year and said Vatican bureaucrats had refused to comply with the commission\u2019s request \u2014 approved by the pope \u2014 to respond to all letters sent to the Vatican by abuse victims. Marie Collins, then a member of the pope's sex abuse commission, in 2015 hands a letter to Cardinal Sean O'Malley detailing the abuse suffered by Juan Carlos Cruz of Chile. Catherine Bonnet / Associated Press Was the pope listening to the commission? Possibly not. In 2015, Collins handed O\u2019Malley a letter addressed to the pope from Juan Carlos Cruz, a Chilean abused as a boy by Chilean prelate Fernando Karadima, who was sentenced by the Vatican to a lifetime of penance in 2010. Cruz described how the abuse was witnessed and covered up by Juan Barros, a priest whose appointment as a bishop in 2015 prompted huge protests in Chile. The pope has stuck by Barros, dismissing the protesters as \u201clefties\u201d and hugging Barros publicly during his visit to Chile last month. \"I can't condemn [Barros] because I don't have evidence,\" he said on the plane back to Rome, suggesting he had ignored or never read the letter from Cruz. That was too much for O\u2019Malley, who said Francis had caused \"great pain\u201d to victims. If Francis was not listening to the commission about Barros, whom was he listening to? Vatican watchers believe the pope was influenced by Chilean Cardinal Francisco Javier Errazuriz, a member of the G9 group who has backed Barros and reportedly helped block moves to make Cruz a member of the abuse commission. So is the pope intransigent on Barros? No. Something changed his mind after his Chilean trip, possibly the scale of the protest against Barros in the country.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

Congo's Health Ministry said two of the five samples it sent to the National Institute of Biological Research in Kinshasa, came back positive for the disease. The samples were gathered after health officials in Equateur Province notified Kinshasa on May 3 of about 21 cases of a hemorrhagic fever in the Ikoko Impenge area, including 17 deaths, according to WHO and Congo's government. What is Ebola? Rare but deadly, the viral disease is most commonly affecting primates and humans. Initial symptoms can include fever, headache, joint and muscle aches, weakness, diarrhoea, vomiting, stomach pain lack of appetite and in some cases internal and external bleeding, according to WHO. Where did it originate from? Ebola virus disease (EVD) was first discovered in 1976 in two simultaneous outbreaks. One in what is now Nzara in South Sudan. The other outbreak in Yambuku in Zaire in what is now DR Congo. The latter occurred in a village near the Ebola River, from which the disease takes its name. Why is it so dangerous? The average Ebola fatality rate is about 50 percent. But the rates have varied from 25 percent to 90 percent in recent outbreaks. There is as of yet no proven cure available for Ebola, though some vaccines are being tested. Some people who have recovered from Ebola have developed long-term complications, such as joint and vision problems. It is not known why some people recover from Ebola while most succumb to the disease. Why does it keep coming back? The disease infects humans through close contact with infected animals, including chimpanzees, fruit bats and forest antelope. In Africa where most outbreaks happen, particular species of fruit bats are considered natural hosts for the Ebola virus. Infected bats are believed to transmit the disease to humans, or indirectly through other animals that are hunted for their meat. The family of the first victim of the 2014 outbreak, a two-year-old child, hunted bats and it is believed bushmeat was the origin of the outbreak. An estimated five million tonnes of bushmeat is consumed on the continent every year, according to the Centre for International Forestry Research. The virus then spreads between humans by direct contact with infected blood, bodily fluids or organs, or indirectly through contact with contaminated environments. Even funerals of Ebola victims can be a risk, if mourners have direct contact with the body of the deceased.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

Kemp has declared victory and said it is \u201cmathematically impossible\u201d for her campaign to force a runoff. Abrams\u2019 campaign did not immediately respond to a phone call from Fox News late Monday night. Abrams, 44, a Democrat, has maintained that she will not concede until every vote has been counted, and pointed to the 5,000 votes tallied over the weekend that favored her. Totenberg, who was appointed by President Obama, ruled in connection to Common Cause\u2019s lawsuit filed on Nov. 5. Totenberg\u2019s order doesn\u2019t change the Tuesday deadline for counties to certify their results. Common Cause, a nonpartisan group, claimed in the suit that Kemp, while secretary of state, failed to maintain \u201cthe security of voter information despite known vulnerabilities\u201d leading up to the midterm. The suit blasted the state\u2019s \u201cprovisional ballot scheme,\u201d that could disenfranchise a registered voter at the ballot box. The suit pointed out cases where voters were turned around after computer glitches and cases where voters were not offered provisional ballots. One man voted for decades and was \u201cdisturbed\u201d to learn his registration history was erased. The court ruled that the secretary of state\u2019s office must establish a hotline and publicize it on its website for voters to see if their provisional ballots were counted. Totenberg also ruled that Georgia must not certify the election results before Friday at 5 p.m., which falls before the Nov. 20 deadline set by state law. \u201cI am fighting to make sure our democracy works for and represents everyone who has ever put their faith in it. I am fighting for every Georgian who cast a ballot with the promise that their vote would count,\u201d Abrams said in a statement explaining her refusal to end her bid to become the first black woman elected governor in American history. A total of 21,190 provisional ballots were cast in the state during the midterm, 12,151 were cast in 2014. Four Democratic-leaning counties with the largest number of provisional ballots \u2014 Cobb, DeKalb, Fulton, and Gwinnett \u2013 \u201chad not yet reported their numbers to the secretary as of November 11,\u201d the suit said. The lawsuit also asked that provisional ballots cast by a voter registered in another county be counted as if the voter had shown up at the wrong precinct. The lawsuit says that of the 1,556 provisional ballots Fulton County reported having rejected by Nov. 9, nearly 1,000 were disqualified because they were cast by voters whose registration records showed them registered in another county. Edgardo Cortes, who currently works as an election security adviser at New York University, said these uncounted provisional ballots could sway the election and, despite Kemp\u2019s claims, his unofficial vote total is so close to 50 percent, a runoff is possible. Kemp was up 50.2 percent to Abrams\u2019 48.7 percent early Tuesday. More than 3.9 million votes were cast in the election, and Abrams would need to acquire more than 20,000 additional votes to force a runoff. Abrams\u2019 campaign filed a lawsuit Sunday asking a federal court to push the deadline for counties to certify their results to Wednesday, while also requiring that elections authorities count certain provisional and absentee ballots that have been or would be rejected for \u201carbitrary reasons.\u201d \u201cThis ruling is a victory for the voters of Georgia because we are all stronger when every eligible voter is allowed to participate in our elections,\u201d Sara Henderson, executive director for Common Cause Georgia, which filed the lawsuit, told AJC.com.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

No wonder the people of our Country are so angry with Illegal Immigration. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 1, 2017 Update 1: AP reports that U.S. immigration officials say they will deport the Mexican man found not guilty of murder in San Francisco pier shooting. * * * As we detailed earlier, in a verdict that has shocked many in the Bay Area (and across America), a jury of six men and six women in sanctuary city San Francisco found illegal immigrant (and five-time deportee) Jose Ines Garcia Zarate not guilty in the death of Kate Steinle. Mr. Garcia Zarate had been homeless at the time of the shooting and had multiple felony convictions and five prior deportations to Mexico. He had been set free from jail only months before the shooting, in defiance of requests by federal immigration authorities, who had asked that he be held longer so he could be deported again. The backlash to his release into the community crescendoed when Donald Trump invoked Ms. Steinle\u2019s killing as he campaigned for president. As The New York Times reports, Ms. Steinle\u2019s death in July 2015 fed into a fierce debate over whether immigrants without legal status should be deported more aggressively, and over the role local law enforcement should play. Ms. Steinle, known as Kate, a 32-year-old medical equipment saleswoman, was walking along Pier 14 in San Francisco when she was struck by a bullet and collapsed into her father\u2019s arms. Mr. Garcia Zarate acknowledged firing the weapon, but said it was an accident. Zarate and his defense team maintained the argument that the suspect found the stolen weapon on the pier that day and it \u201cjust fired.\u201d The gun belonged to a federal Bureau of Land Management ranger and was stolen from his parked car a week earlier. The bullet ricocheted on the pier\u2019s concrete walkway before it struck Steinle, killing her. Zarate has admitted to shooting Steinle, but says it was an accident. Defense attorney Matt Gonzalez said Garcia Zarate found the gun at the pier\u2026 but the stories of what happened copntradicted one another\u2026 He said it was wrapped in cloth, and when Garcia Zarate unwrapped it, the gun accidentally discharged. But in a police interrogation, Garcia Zarate admitted to firing the gun, saying he was aiming at a seal. He also told police that he stepped on the gun, causing it to fire. But still, after six days of deliberation, the illegal Mexcian immigrant was acquitted of murder and manslaughter charges and also found not guilty of assault with a firearm. Garcia Zarate was found guilty of illegal firearms possession, which carries a sentence of 16 months to three years. * * * The public defender wasted no time in focusing his thoughts on President Trump and his administration\u2026saying Zarate was \u201cextremely relieved\u201d by the outcome and that while Steinle\u2019s death \u201cwas a horrible tragedy,\u201d it was used as \u201cpolitical fodder for then candidate Donald Trump\u2019s anti-immigration agenda.\u201d Adachi added, \u201cDespite the unfairly politicized atmosphere surrounding this case, jurors focused on the evidence, which was clear and convincing, and rendered a just verdict.\u201d In a response to the verdict, Attorney General Jeff Sessions released a statement saying that despite California\u2019s attempt at a murder conviction, Zarate was able to walk away with only a firearm possession conviction because he was not turned over by San Francisco to ICE. \u201cWhen jurisdictions choose to return criminal aliens to the streets rather than turning them over to federal immigration authorities, they put the public\u2019s safety at risk,\u201d the statement said. \u201cSan Francisco\u2019s decision to protect criminal aliens led to the preventable and heartbreaking death of Kate Steinle.\u201d Sessions continued, \u201cI urge the leaders of the nation\u2019s communities to reflect on the outcome of this case and consider carefully the harm they are doing to their citizens by refusing to cooperate with federal law enforcement officers.\u201d Social media erupted with outrage at the verdict (with very few \u2013 if any attempting to defend the verdict)\u2026 I don't know any American citizen who is a 5x felon and could get away with killing someone with a stolen gun. #KateSteinle #KatesLaw #JoseZarate \u2014 Ginger (@SpicyMustang) December 1, 2017 I seriously feel like buying my own damn bricks & building this damn wall myself!

            "question": "Which of the following tactics is used in the following text?\n\nArticle: Muslim Crime Stopper Sofian Zakkout's New Crush: Anti-Semite Pastor Steve Anderson For nearly two millennia, Jews have suffered persecution after persecution at the hands of those who used religion as a vehicle for hate and even mass murder. Recently, a video clip of anti-Semitic pastor Steve Anderson \u2013 making the claim that Jews have experienced such abuse because they have somehow been cursed \u2013 wound up on the personal Facebook page of South Florida Muslim leader Sofian Zakkout. According to Zakkout, who sits on the boards of two anti-crime groups, Anderson\u2019s declaration \u201cmakes a lot of sense.\u201d With statements like this from Zakkout and worse, why would groups committed to fighting crime continue to compromise themselves and sabotage their mission by affiliating with him? Sofian Abdelaziz Zakkout is the President of the American Muslim Association of North America (AMANA), a prominent Islamic organization headquartered in North Miami Beach, Florida. On January 25th, Zakkout posted onto his personal Facebook page a video clip of a speech made by Steve Anderson, the pastor of the Faithful Word Baptist Church in Tempe, Arizona. Anderson is notorious for calling for the killing of gays to end AIDS. In the clip, Anderson states the following: \u201cAnd the Jews were scattered into all nations for literally 2000 years, right? For 1800 sum odd years. And by the way, everywhere they were scattered, they were persecuted, hated, treated badly. Why? \u2018Cause God\u2019s blessing them? No. \u2018Cause they\u2019re under the curse of God for having rejected the Lord Jesus Christ.\u201d Blaming Jews for the extreme torment they endured for so long, which includes a Nazi Holocaust that took the lives of six million innocent Jews and so many others, is incredibly offensive. Indeed, statements and beliefs such as Anderson\u2019s have provoked hatred and persecution of Jews. Towards the end of the clip, which is less than four minutes in length, Anderson throws the anti-Semitism in people\u2019s faces. He zealously states, while drawing laughter from his small audience, \u201cYou say, \u2018Why are you preaching against the Jews?\u2019 Well, don\u2019t come back next Wednesday night. Because, next Wednesday night, God\u2019s wrath is on the Jews even more!\u201d About the clip, on Facebook, Zakkout wrote above it, \u201cMakes a lot of sense!\u201d Of course, this is coming from someone [Zakkout] who regularly refers to Jews as \u201cmonkeys and pigs,\u201d and in February 2016, circulated on social media a report claiming that \u201cthe Holocaust was faked.\u201d The report calls the Holocaust \u201cthe biggest lie ever foisted upon humanity\u201d and was produced by a media outlet which describes Hitler as \u201cthe greatest leader in modern Western history.\u201d Both Anderson and Zakkout have been denounced by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) for their propagation of anti-Semitism. In July 2010, the ADL condemned Zakkout and his group AMANA for featuring an anti-Jewish video produced by former KKK leader and white supremacist David Duke on the AMANA website. The ADL described the video as \u201cvenomous.\u201d In October 2015, Zakkout praised Duke, as \u201cDavid Duke, a man to believe in!\u201d Besides posting videos from Steve Anderson and David Duke on his Facebook page, Zakkout also, in July 2017, posted a four minute clip from a speech made by Nation of Islam (NOI) leader Louis Farrakhan. During the clip, Farrakhan repeatedly labels the Jewish people \u201cSatan.\u201d He states, \u201cReally, they\u2019re not Jews. No, that\u2019s Satan. You should learn to call them by their real name, \u2018Satan.\u2019 You\u2019re coming face to face with Satan, the Arch Deceiver, the enemy of God, and the enemy of the righteous.\u201d Zakkout is also an ardent supporter of the terrorist organization Hamas, if not a member himself. In July 2014, he organized a pro-Hamas rally held outside the Israeli Consulate in downtown Miami. Rally goers repeatedly shouted, \u201cWe are Hamas\u201d and \u201cLet\u2019s go Hamas.\u201d After the rally, Zakkout wrote the following in Arabic, above photos from the event: \u201cThank God, every day we conquer the American Jews like our conquests over the Jews of Israel!\u201d He signed it \u201cBr. Sofian Zakkout.\u201d The next month, Zakkout declared in Arabic, \"Hamas is in my heart and on my head.\" All of the above testifies to hatred and intolerance, but it is even more disturbing given the fact that Zakkout sits on the boards of two anti-crime organizations: Crime Stoppers of Miami-Dade County and Citizens\u2019 Crime Watch of Miami-Dade County. Serving alongside Zakkout on these boards are local politicians and law enforcement officials. One would think that they would find Zakkout\u2019s actions and bigotry unacceptable, as well, yet Zakkout continues to serve unchallenged. If the board members of Crime Stoppers and Citizens\u2019 Crime Watch do not wish to be associated with anti-Semitism or white supremacism or Hamas or Holocaust denial or Steve Anderson or David Duke or Louis Farrakhan, then they must cut ties with Sofian Zakkout. The time is long overdue that these groups maintain their credibility and remain true to their stated missions of protecting and safeguarding the American public. Sofian Zakkout\u2019s bigoted and radical agenda is antithetical to this and is a documented threat to national security. His presence on the boards of both organizations constitutes an obscene travesty. Once and for all, these groups need to divorce themselves from Zakkout and repudiate what he stands for.

Once again this year we see that Ramadan is quintessentially the month of jihad. A jihad group explained it back in 2012: \u201cThe month of Ramadan is a month of holy war and death for Allah. It is a month for fighting the enemies of Allah and God\u2019s messenger, the Jews and their American facilitators.\u201d Referring to a jihad attack that happened at that time, the message continued: \u201cOne of our groups aided by Allah managed to bomb a bus full of Jewish tourists, plunderers of holy lands, after careful tracking. The holy war is not confined to a particular arena and we shall fight the Jews and the Americans until they leave the land of Islam.\u201d In contrast, President Trump issued a statement claiming that \u201cRamadan reminds us of the richness Muslims add to the religious tapestry of American life.\u201d take our poll - story continues below Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?

Does Ramadan remind us of \u201cthe richness Muslims add to the religious tapestry of American life,\u201d or is Ramadan \u201ca month of calamity everywhere for nonbelievers\u201d? Islam\u2019s core beliefs make it clear that the latter statement is closer to the truth. During Ramadan, Muslims are exhorted to renew and deepen their devotion to Allah. Hence it is a time when they\u2019re supposed to grow more generous and kind toward their fellow Muslims. However, the Qur\u2019an says: \u201cMuhammad is the Messenger of Allah, and those who are with him are severe against disbelievers, and merciful among themselves\u201d (48:29). If the Ramadan imperative is to become more devout, the Muslim who applies himself diligently to the Ramadan observance will simultaneously become more both merciful to his fellow Muslims and more severe against the unbelievers. Murdering infidels thus doesn\u2019t contradict the spirit of Ramadan; it embodies it. The Kavkaz Center, a website operated by Chechen jihadists, explained in a 2010 article that the idea of Ramadan as a time for warfare against infidels went back to Muhammad\u2019s time: \u201cThe month of Ramadan in the life of the Prophet (pbuh) and the righteous ancestors was a month of forthcoming. The greatest battles during the lifetime of the Prophet (pbuh) occurred in this blessed month, the month of jihad, zeal and enthusiasm.\u201d Trump was, unfortunately, following the example of his two immediate predecessors when he claimed that \u201cRamadan reminds us of the richness Muslims add to the religious tapestry of American life,\u201d and was severely misleading the American people. Ironically, even in doing this he is likely to fail to satisfy Muslims, or anyone. After all, after the Trump White House issued a similar statement last year, the Washington Post ran a lengthy piece in which several Muslims explained why the statement was unsatisfactory to them. Shadi Hamid of the Qatar-funded Brookings Institution declared: \u201cTrump has so rarely recognized that American Muslims even exist, but this offers apparent proof that he is aware of our existence. Great! Putting all that context aside, it\u2019s offensive and pretty much terrible.\u201d Why? Because Trump had the temerity to mention jihad terrorism. Hamid continued: \u201cWe, as American Muslims, shouldn\u2019t be defined solely in our relationship to bad things that we have nothing to do with. We\u2019re also normal people who happen to be Muslim and to see us and our history in America so narrowly is plain out offensive.\u201d What is actually offensive is that Hamid would try in this way to absolve the Muslim community of any responsibility to root out jihad terrorist from its midst. There is certain to be more jihad terrorism during this Ramadan, and some of it may be committed by Muslims in the U.S. Hamid, if he cared about this, would be confronting honestly the teachings of Islam that make Ramadan the month of jihad, and working to reform them. Meanwhile, it would be dangerous, suicidal folly for Infidels to pretend that Ramadan is not the month of jihad. And as our Ramadan willful blindness continues, more Infidels will die.

            "question": "Which of the following tactics is used in the following text?\n\nArticle: San Francisco Show Trial Sequel Last week, a San Francisco jury acquitted seven-time felon Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, a repeatedly deported Mexican national, of all murder and manslaughter charges in the July 1, 2015, fatal shooting of Kate Steinle as she walked with her father and a friend on Pier 14. The jury found the confessed shooter guilty only of felony gun possession. Many observers decried the verdict as a travesty of justice, but they were mistaken if they thought it could not get any worse. San Francisco public defender Matt Gonzalez now seeks to have Zarate\u2019s gun possession charge dismissed. Gonzalez is contending the jury should have been told that \u201cmomentary\u201d possession of a gun is not necessarily a crime. \u201cIf you possess it just to dispose of it or abandon it, it wouldn\u2019t be a crime,\u201d Gonzalez told reporters. The Steinle family and relatives of murder victims have new cause for outrage, but this gambit is consistent with Gonzalez and the San Francisco show-trial in which he co-starred. Gonzalez hails from McAllen, Texas, and attended Columbia University on a scholarship. As he explained, \u201cI think I was a product of affirmative action,\u201d and ethnic preferences doubtless played a role in admission to Stanford Law School. In San Francisco, Gonzalez became known as \u201cThe Great Left Hope,\u201d and a hero to Bay Area radicals. The La Raza Lawyers Association named Gonzalez Lawyer of the Year, and the Mexican American Political Association, a group with roots in the Communist Party, gave him the Bert Corona award, after one of the CPUSA\u2019s most high-profile Stalinists. In 2,000, after a decade as a public defender, Gonzalez gained election to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. In 2003, as board president, he commissioned a graffiti artist to spray SMASH THE STATE on his office wall, in \u201ctraffic cone orange.\u201d As Gonzalez explained, \u201cThis is a sentiment I think all of us have had. You have to rally and find ways of opposing what you don\u2019t like.\u201d In 2003 Gonzalez ran for mayor of San Francisco but lost to Gavin Newsom. In 2008 Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader tapped Gonzalez for vice president. \u201cHe has a great, steadfast commitment to justice,\u201d Nader told reporters. On that score, the Steinle family and other relatives of murder victims have room for reasonable doubt. In jury selection, Gonzalez and the prosecutor, assistant district attorney Diana Garcia, included three \u201cimmigrants,\u201d quite possibly false-documented illegals. True to form, judge Samuel Feng sealed the identities of the jurors. So observers have grounds to believe that Garcia and Gonzalez both got the jury they wanted. Garcia told the court Zarate was playing his own \u201csecret version of Russian roulette,\u201d and thus parroted the defense\u2019s contention that the shooting was all a matter of chance. As it happens, in Russian roulette a shooter loads one bullet into a six-shot revolver, spins the cylinder, then puts the gun to his own head and pulls the trigger. In a central fact of the case, Zarate did not aim the gun at himself but fired in the direction of Kate Steinle. In another established fact, the bullet struck her in the lower back and tore through her abdominal aorta. This happened in broad daylight, but as in In the Heat of the Night, they had the body which was dead. Garcia Zarate confessed to firing the shot and had gunpowder residue on his hands. After firing, he tossed the gun in the water. He said he had found the stolen weapon wrapped in a cloth and that it discharged by itself, both utterly unbelievable claims. Even so, the politically correct jury found the career criminal not guilty of murder and manslaughter. Any observer could be forgiven for believing that prosecution and defense both got the outcome they wanted. Unlike Stalin\u2019s trials of the old Bolsheviks, and Fidel Castro\u2019 trial of General Arnaldo Ochoa, this show trial aimed to establish innocence for the guilty, and the dynamics of the left were on full display. Denunciations of \u201cgun violence\u201d were nowhere in evidence and expressions of sympathy for the Steinle family proved pathetically weak. As Arthur Koestler said, on the left the truth is spoken with loathing and falsehood with love. On the left, as Orwell had it in Animal Farm, rats are comrades, and criminals are victims of capitalist society. In the view of Gonzalez, society is progressing toward a social justice paradise ruled by a wise elite that knows what\u2019s best for all. In this inexorable progress, determined by history, some people are going to have to die. As Bertolt Brecht told Sidney Hook about Stalin\u2019s victims, \u201cthe more innocent they are, the more they deserve to be shot.\u201d Out for a summer-day walk with her father and a friend, Kate Steinle was a completely innocent victim, gunned down by a career criminal who was not even supposed to be in the country but found special protection in the sanctuary city of San Francisco, part of the sanctuary state of California. As defense attorney Francisco Ugarte said, the verdict was a \u201cvindication for the rights of immigrants.\u201d Since Donald Trump mentioned the case, former vice-presidential candidate Matt Gonzalez had to establish the complete innocence of the shooter. That explains the effort of \u201cThe Great Left Hope\u201d to have his client\u2019s felony gun possession conviction tossed. Any observer of the case could believe it probably will be.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

Designating the IRGC as a terrorist organization and imposing new sanctions for its aggressive actions in the region is not a restoration of the sanctions lifted by the Obama administration as part of its disastrous nuclear deal with Iran. If Iran insists it can do what it wants militarily in terms of missile launches, support of terrorist groups such as Hezbollah and Hamas, and arms transfers without violating the nuclear deal, then the United States can certainly act to curb such activities through financial pressure. The U.S. can impose sanctions against the Iranian regime\u2019s principal instrument for projecting aggressive, destabilizing force outside of its borders without violating the nuclear deal. The Iranian regime does not see it that way, however. With the lifting of the nuclear-related sanctions making available billions of dollars to Iran\u2019s leaders to further finance the IRGC\u2019s exploits in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen and elsewhere, the regime is furious that the Trump administration is tightening the financial screws again, even if for reasons not directly related to Iran\u2019s compliance with the terms of the nuclear deal. Thus, it is threatening U.S. forces and bases in the region. A couple of seemingly unrelated events this past week point to Iran\u2019s positioning itself for more aggressive military actions that could place U.S. forces in harm\u2019s way. On Tuesday, Major General Bagheri landed in Damascus for talks with Syrian President Bashar Assad and senior Syrian officials, including the defense minister and the chief of staff of the Syrian armed forces. Bagheri is quoted as saying that his visit\u2019s purpose was to \u201cput a joint strategy on continuing co-ordination and co-operation at the military level.\u201d Some experts on Iran believe that Bagheri\u2019s visit to Damascus at this time is intended to reinforce a message that Iran will continue to supply weaponry to Syria and to reinforce the presence of its terrorist proxy Hezbollah in Syria. This will not only serve to bolster the Assad regime, but it also will strengthen Iran's ability to follow through on its threats to the U.S. and its allies, principally Israel. Meanwhile, following the departure of the Kurds from Kirkuk, Iraq earlier this week, the IRGC\u2019s operational Al Qods arm reportedly established a command center and five bases there. According to Debkafile, this constitutes \u201cthe first military facility Iran has ever established openly in Iraq.\u201d The Kirkuk region holds 45 percent of Iraqi\u2019s oil. The Iraqi branch of Iran\u2019s terrorist proxy Hezbollah has vowed that once ISIS is defeated it will start killing Americans, as it has done before. It is against this backdrop that U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley used her entire speech to the UN Security Council on Wednesday to denounce the Iranian regime on multiple grounds. The session was supposed to be devoted to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but Ambassador Haley departed from the monthly ritual during which Israel is normally singled out for criticism by other Council members. She went after Iran instead. She explained why the Trump administration decided to take \u201ca comprehensive approach to confronting the Iranian regime,\u201d which does not give the regime a get out of jail free card even if it is in technical compliance with the loophole-ridden nuclear deal agreed to by the Obama administration. \u201cWe can\u2019t talk about stability in the Middle East without talking about Iran,\u201d Ambassador Haley said. \u201cThat\u2019s because nearly every threat to peace and security in the Middle East is connected to Iran\u2019s outlaw behavior. The United States has now embarked on a course that attempts to address all aspects of Iran\u2019s destructive conduct, not just one aspect. It\u2019s critical that the international community do the same. Judging Iran by the narrow confines of the nuclear deal misses the true nature of the threat. Iran must be judged in totality of its aggressive, destabilizing, and unlawful behavior. To do otherwise would be foolish.\u201d Ambassador Haley accused the Iranian regime of continuing to \u201cplay\u201d the Security Council. \u201cIran hides behind its assertion of technical compliance with the nuclear deal while it brazenly violates the other limits on its behavior. And we have allowed them to get away with it. This must stop.\u201d Ambassador Haley proceeded to list various violations by the Iranian regime of Security Council resolutions pertaining to the transfer of conventional weapons from Iran and the arming of terrorist groups, including the Houthi rebels in Yemen and Hezbollah. She also pointed to what she called the Iranian regime\u2019s \u201cmost threatening act\u201d \u2013 its launch of ballistic missiles capable of carrying nuclear weapons. \u201cWhen a rogue regime starts down the path of ballistic missiles, it tells us that we will soon have another North Korea on our hands,\u201d Ambassador Haley said. \u201cIf it is wrong for North Korea to do this, why doesn\u2019t that same mentality apply to Iran? \u201c As for the Iran\u2019s supposed technical compliance with its commitments under the nuclear deal itself, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the UN\u2019s international inspectors are not able to visit Iran\u2019s military sites.

Years ago numerous Indonesian Christians came illegally to the United States and submitted asylum applications. Those asylum applications were reviewed by the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), the immigration courts. The claims were rejected as unsubstantiated and the illegal aliens ordered deported. However, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) declined to enforce those deportation orders, called Final Order Of Removal During the 10 or so years that the cases involving Indonesian Christians were free to remain in the United States, those illegal aliens did not make any effort to appeal their outstanding orders. Then the United States had an election, and the policy of not enforcing those and many other Final Orders of Removal was ended. Then suddenly, those illegal aliens claimed they were being denied an opportunity to file for asylum or were not receiving due process. They filed a case in the Federal courts and were assigned to a Kritarch, Patti Saris, who apparently thinks she runs immigration policy, even after aliens have had their day in court. Saris thinks she can usurp the Constitution of the United States based on her whims regarding immigration policy. Kritarch Patti Saris In her latest excursion into immigration enforcement policy, she decided that illegal aliens can't be held in custody for their return to their home country. BOSTON (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Wednesday ordered the release of an illegal immigrant who is among 47 Indonesians in New Hampshire challenging the Trump administration\u2019s order to deport them. The man, Terry Rombot, had been allowed to remain under the terms of a 2010 deal with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement until this year, when President Donald Trump instructed ICE that all people living in the United States illegally were subject to deportation. [U.S. Judge Frees Indonesian Immigrant Held By Trump Order, by Nate Raymond, Reuters, November 1, 2017] First, let's deal with the misleading reporting. Rombot was not taken into custody based on any ICE policy of deporting all illegal aliens. Rombot was taken into custody because he had an outstanding Final Order Of Removal; that's a big difference and symptomatic of the lies from reporters like Raymond. Saris previously ordered a stay to the deportations. She is currently weighing whether she can order a longer delay to give the affected people time to renew their efforts to gain legal status. Now, with regard to Saris, she has no authority to interfere with the pre-deportation custody of an illegal alien with a Final Order Of Removal. Rombot was taken into custody because he was soon to be deported. There was no issue of Indonesia not accepting him nor of Indonesia not providing a travel document, so there was no question of him being held in custody longer than allowed in the St. Cyr decision that restricted custody of illegal aliens with Final Orders Of Removal who for whatever reason were unlikely to be successfully deported. She still thinks that she can review the underlying decision of the immigration court as well.In fact, Saris' actions appear to more akin to that of the Mexican kritarch Monica Herranz who aided an illegal alien to escape arrest by ICE when she let that illegal alien leave her courtroom through the exit to her judicial chambers. Saris is clearly scheming to help Rombot escape deportation by disappearing into the almost 1 million illegal aliens absconding from Final Orders of Removal Time for Congress to impeach Saris and to remove authority from lesser courts to review immigration law enforcement, detention, and deportation decisions.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

India wants to tackle both those firsts in one fell swoop this year, with its Chandrayaan-2 mission, a trio of orbiter, lander and rover that would represent the country's second visit to the moon. The mission is scheduled to launch sometime in the first half of this year, no earlier than March. Its target is a patch of lunar surface about 370 miles away from the south pole, where scientists think the rock may be 4 billion years old, formed just after the moon's giant ocean of liquid rock began to solidify. The region is an area NASA would also like to visit, preferably with a robot that would bring souvenir rock home to Earth for scientists to analyze directly in the laboratory. But despite NASA's renewed focus on lunar exploration, as dictated in December by an order from President Trump, the agency won't beat India back to the moon. Dibyangshu Sarkar/AFP/Getty Images That's even after India's Chandrayaan-2 mission was delayed by three years after Russia backed out of designing and producing the mission's lander. Rather than lose out on that part of the mission, the Indian Space Research Organization decided to just do it themselves. But they aren't sure how long they can expect the mission to last once the lander and rover arrive\u2014it could be over in as little as two weeks, ending as soon as the sun sets, since the mission runs on solar power and the polar area is quite shadowy even during the day. During that time, the team hopes to gather data about charged particles around the moon and the small \"moonquakes\" that ripple through its surface.

Now, scientists know that ice is likely concentrated at the poles, where it could become an important resource for human and robotic explorers alike. The orbiter piece of the upcoming mission will look to build on its predecessor by mapping how water actually moves around the moon. In the long term, India has its sights set well beyond the moon, with dreams of visiting Mars, Venus or an asteroid.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

But the 7-year-old is also a huge fan of the weekly Bible course at Princeton Primary, his public elementary school. He gets to play matching games about Bible stories and listen to classic tales. Noah and the Ark is a favorite. Adam and Eve and the garden of Eden, of course. And the story about how their son Cain killed his brother, Abel. \u201cThat one was a little bit of a surprise,\u201d Trenton said as he sat with his parents, Brett and Courtney Tolliver, one day this month watching his little sister\u2019s soccer practice on a lush field in this small town in the mountains of southern West Virginia. This spring, Bible classes such as Trenton\u2019s are on the minds of many here in Mercer County. For decades, the county\u2019s public schools have offered a weekly Bible class during the school day \u2014 30 minutes at the elementary level and 45 minutes in middle school. Bible classes on school time are a rarity in public education, but here they are a long-standing tradition. The program is not mandatory, but almost every child in the district attends. And there is widespread support for the classes: Parents and community members help raise nearly $500,000 a year to pay for the Bible in the Schools program. Now Bible in the Schools is facing a stiff legal challenge. Two county residents with school-age children argue in a lawsuit that the program violates the establishment clause of the First Amendment and the West Virginia constitution. Filed in January and amended last month by the Freedom From Religion Foundation, the suit charges that the Bible class \u201cadvances and endorses one religion, improperly entangles public schools in religious affairs, and violates the personal consciences of nonreligious and non-Christian parents and students.\u201d Supporters are adamant that the weekly class is an elective meant to explore the history and literature of the Bible, not to promote religious belief. \u201cMy experience with it has been very positive. I\u2019ve never known of anyone who has been pressured or felt ostracized,\u201d said the Rev. David W. Dockery, senior pastor at First Baptist Church of Princeton. \u201cAny time God\u2019s word can be proclaimed is beneficial and is a good thing.\u201d Trenton\u2019s parents also find it hard to see why there would be objections. \u201cI think it\u2019s a great program mainly because it\u2019s the only chance for some of these kids to even see the Bible,\u201d said Brett Tolliver, 27. \u201cMore importantly, I don\u2019t know who it harms. The kids aren\u2019t forced to be there.\u201d Courtney Tolliver, 26, a teacher in the district, agrees. \u201cIt\u2019s not teaching religion, but it teaches character and respect and how important it is to tell the truth,\u201d she said. \u201cThe kids love it and the ones who don\u2019t participate aren\u2019t made to feel left out.\u201d But the plaintiffs in the suit and their backers argue that the program\u2019s popularity shouldn\u2019t matter in the face of Supreme Court rulings such as McCollum v. Board of Education in 1948 that have banned public schools from initiating or sponsoring religious activity. The suit alleges that the lessons in the Mercer schools are similar to what a child would hear in Sunday school and that they advocate the Ten Commandments and treat stories in the Bible as historical fact. The suit quotes from one lesson: \u201cIf all of the Israelites had chosen to follow the Ten Commandments, think of how safe and happy they would have been.\u201d Another lesson asks students to imagine that humans and dinosaurs existed at the same time. It says: \u201cSo picture Adam being able to crawl up on the back of a dinosaur! He and Eve could have their own personal water slide! Wouldn\u2019t that be so wild!\u201d The district declined a request to observe one of the classes. Elizabeth Deal, who describes herself as agnostic, is one of the plaintiffs in the case. Her daughter attended elementary school in nearby Bluefield, but Deal kept her out of the Bible class. Even though the class was optional, Deal said there weren\u2019t any alternative lessons or activities for those who opted out. Her daughter was told to sit in the computer lab for that half-hour and read a book. Bypassing the class left her vulnerable to bullying. Deal said other students told her daughter that she was going to hell. One day a student saw her daughter reading a \u201cHarry Potter\u201d novel and told her, according to the mother: \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be reading this. You need to be reading the Bible.\u201d Eventually Deal moved her daughter to a public school a few miles away in Virginia where there is no Bible class. She pays an out-of-state fee of several hundred dollars, but she no longer worries about her child being taunted. Deal said she joined the suit because she believes strongly in the separation of church and state. \u201cWhen something is wrong,\u201d she said, \u201cyou have to stand up against it.\u201d God is a big deal in Mercer County, home to about 125 churches that dominate the main streets of its biggest towns, Princeton (population 6,400) and Bluefield (10,400), and smaller burgs such as Athens (1,000), Bramwell (360) and Oakvale (120). A lot of the good jobs in the county have left \u2014 22 percent of its 61,000 residents live below the poverty level \u2014 but the churches have stayed. You can find the Church of God here. And the Church of Christ. And the Church of Jesus. There are a couple of Catholic churches, a synagogue and a mosque, but the vast majority of houses of worship are Baptist, Methodist or Pentecostal. The radio in the region is filled with gospel stations, Bible talk shows and Christian rock. Billboards tout the Ten Commandments or offer stern messages on abortion and eternal salvation.

Now Bishop emeritus Andreas Laun \u2013 one of the signatories of the Kazakh \u201cProfession of Truth about Sacramental Marriage\u201d \u2013 has written a strong commentary for the Austrian Catholic news website Kath.net on the recent episcopal initiatives coming out of Germany. In the following, we shall present to our readers the essential parts of Bishop Laun's statement, in our English translation from the German. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Dear Cardinal Marx and dear Bishop Bode, there is only one Catholic answer: No! And your addition \u201cin individual cases\u201d is absolutely worthless, it has no argumentative force. A clear statement by Bishop Andreas Laun for Kath.net. Cardinal Marx and also Bishop Bode have now opened up to the idea to offer homosexual couples a blessing. Why not, one could say, since the Church is ready to bless nearly everything on the earth? Now, the Church especially blesses people, but also deeds and objects. The Jesuit Father Eckhard Bieger writes in the Internet about Catholic blessings: For Catholics, really everything can be blessed, not only places of worship, chalices, and the faithful after each prayer service \u2013 whether after a Mass, or after the prayers for the hours of the day. The blessing is also not limited to rosaries or religious medal, but one may also bless cars, factory halls, animals, herbs, and much more. Some blessings are only to be made by priests and deacons, especially when it is about objects of worship such as chalices or vestments. But parents can bless their children. The faithful may also take home holy water and sprinkle it on members of the family, but also the stable and the animals, thus blessing them. [...] What kind of hope is connected with a blessing? With regard to the car, certainly the wish for heavenly protection \u2013 sometimes also expressed with the help of a medal of St. Christopher, the patron saint of car drivers. With the weather blessing, one prays explicitly for protection against hail, lightning and drought. [\u2026] To bless always means that something shall flourish, because only then when there is a blessing upon a cause or a project, will something good come out of it. The blessing comes from God, He is being addressed in the form of a request; and it is given to people, objects, and buildings, with the help of the sign of the cross, holy water, and incense. [\u2026] But now concerning the question of Cardinal Marx, and not a few of the priests, the answer is simple: one may ask for God's blessing for sinners, but not for the sin. That is to say, one could not consecrate a brothel, one could not bless a concentration camp or weapons which are not explicitly ordained for hunting or for legitimate self-defense. Therefore it is clear that one may not bless a relationship which is sinful; [one may not bless] the mafia; no blessing for organizations or institutions which promote or procure abortions or which propagate ideologies which are against the Faith, antisemitic contents, or other forms of racist thought. If one considers and weighs this matter, one knows: one may not bless a union of two homosexual men or of lesbian women. Of course [one could bless] two men or women who are de facto homosexual, and that it what happens in each Holy Mass which is being attended by them. This blessing \u2013 which is not related to their acts \u2013 is being received also by all the other sinners, and the Church thereby hopes that they will convert under the influence of God's Grace! This position which is really simple and easily to be understood has been clearly and convincingly presented \u2013 since the statement of the two bishops [Marx and Bode] \u2013 by several Christians: by Archbishops Ludwig Schick (Germany) and Charles Chaput (USA); by the German-speaking theologians Hubert Windisch and Markus B\u00fcning. I am sure there are many many others, too, who think alike, but whom I do not know. Dear Cardinal Marx and dear Bishop Bode, there is only one Catholic answer: No! And your addition \u201cin individual cases\u201d is absolutely worthless, it has no argumentative force. What would St. John the Baptist have said if Herod, taking for himself his brother's wife, would have excusingly called himself an \u201cindividual case\u201d! The idea to bless sinful conduct is really what Isaiah described quite vividly, as follows: \u201cWoe to you that call evil good, and good evil: that put darkness for light, and light for darkness: that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter.\u201d [Isaiah 5:20] Is this not exactly what Cardinal Marx \u2013 and others who are thinking like him \u2013 are doing? If one were to place on a bottle of sour cucumbers a tag \u201choney,\u201d the cucumbers still remain sour! Even blessing bishops cannot change that. Nor can the pope, in calling for a cultural revolution, especially since he does not explain what he exactly means by it. He says that he \u201callows himself\u201d to talk like that \u2013 but if one dares something, one might win, but one also can perish. That seems to catch on these days. For example, the Italian moral theologian, Maurizio Chiodi, recently claimed in his talk at the Gregorian Pontifical University that contraception is sometimes not only not forbidden, but even demanded! To contradict two popes \u2013 whom the Church has already \u201cbeatified\u201d the one and \u201ccanonized\u201d the other \u2013 so shortly after their deaths, and in such a radical and open manner, probably has never happened before in the Church's history.

As Miller documented, this official \u2014 whom the paper did not name because she was a covert agent at the time \u2014 was centrally involved in the worst abuses of the CIA\u2019s Bush-era torture regime. As Miller put it, she was \u201cdirectly involved in its controversial interrogation program\u201d and had an \u201cextensive role\u201d in torturing detainees.

Beyond all that, she played a vital role in the destruction of interrogation videotapes that showed the torture of detainees both at the black site she ran and other secret agency locations. The concealment of those interrogation tapes, which violated multiple court orders as well as the demands of the 9/11 commission and the advice of White House lawyers, was condemned as \u201cobstruction\u201d by commission chairs Lee Hamilton and Thomas Keane. A special prosecutor and grand jury investigated those actions but ultimately chose not to prosecute. The name of that CIA official whose torture activities the Post described is Gina Haspel. Today, as BuzzFeed\u2019s Jason Leopold noted, CIA Director Mike Pompeo announced that Haspel was selected by Trump to be deputy director of the CIA.

Why?\u201d Now it\u2019s clear why. They wanted to hold off as long as possible on identifying this terrorist as another Muslim, and this as another jihad terror attack. Protecting the image of Islam, not protecting the public, still seems to be the most important priority for all too many American officials. \u201cMan whose vehicle exploded at Travis AFB identified,\u201d KGO, March 23, 2018: TRAVIS AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (KGO) \u2014 A man who drove into Travis AFB has been identified as 51-year-old Hafiz Kazi, two sources with knowledge of the probe tell ABC News. The sources described Kazi as a \u201cnomad\u201d and a \u201cvagabond,\u201d who lived in many places. Authorities extracted a video from his cell phone and are analyzing it to try and see if it could help point to a motive. Sources wouldn\u2019t offer any details about the video. The FBI is holding a press conference Friday at 3:30 p.m. and will be asking the public for help and any information about Kazi. Sources say the information gathered so far still does not point to a concrete motive, with one source calling the man a \u201cmystery\u201d still. Terrorism, mental health issues, and everything else are still on the table as authorities try to uncover a motive. On Wednesday, the car crashed at the main gate of Travis Air Force Base.

Now, however, on Monday, the department announced that officer Amber Guyger has finally been fired. On Monday, the Dallas police department announced that the officer who admitted to walking into the apartment of 26-year-old Botham Jean and killing him was finally fired. \u201cDallas Police Chief U. Renee Hall terminated Police Officer Amber Guyger, #10702, during a hearing held September 24, 2018,\u201d the statement read. \u201cAn Internal Affairs investigation concluded that on September 9, 2018, Officer Guyger, #10702, engaged in adverse conduct when she was arrested for Manslaughter.\u201d take our poll - story continues below Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?

The department then went on to note that Guyger could appeal this firing under their civil service rules. Officer Guyger was terminated for her actions. She was hired in November 2013 and was assigned to the Southeast Patrol Division. Under civil service rules, Officer Guyger has the right to appeal her discipline. This move is noteworthy as the department has been standing up against those who have been calling for the officer to be fired. As recently as Friday, Hall refused to fire Guyger, saying in part, \u201cThere is one overriding reason that I have not taken any administrative or employment action against Officer Amber Guyger. I don\u2019t want to interfere with the on-going criminal investigation into her actions.\u201d Also, in a town hall meeting last week, Hall again stood behind her choice to refuse to fire Guyger, claiming it would be against the law. \u201cI can\u2019t do that because there are both local, state and federal laws that prohibit me from taking action. There are civil service laws we have to adhere to,\u201d said Hall. Apparently, it is no longer against the law. This news will likely be well received by the Jean family as well as the activists who have been calling for justice for Botham since the beginning. As TFTP previously reported, the idea of not firing Guyger seemed utterly preposterous as she admitted to doing something wrong. While controversy swarms the case of why she may have killed Jean, there is no doubt that she did kill him. This is a fact. This public servant walked into an innocent man\u2019s home and shot him dead. Because of her actions, this man no longer lives. This alone should have been enough to fire her. Surprisingly enough, NRA spokesperson Dana Loesch responded to the firing of Guyger with one word, \u201cGood,\u201d showing her support for the move. For those who don\u2019t recall, Loesch sparked controversy earlier this month by claiming that if Botham Jean were a gun owner, he may be alive today. Indeed, as TFTP reported over the weekend, a father in Prince George\u2019s County opened fire on officers as they wrongly entered his apartment. He shot two officers. Not only was he not arrested, but the police chief praised him and apologized. In response to Guyger\u2019s termination, the family\u2019s attorney, Lee Merritt noted that the family expressed \u201csatisfaction\u201d with the move. \u201cThe Jean family expressed satisfaction in this explanation and in Guyger\u2019s termination. We see it as an initial victory \u2014 well received on the day Botham Jean is laid to rest in his native country in St. Lucia,\u201d Merritt\u2019s office said in a statement, adding that they are committed to see a \u201cproper murder indictment, conviction and appropriate sentencing.\u201d Article posted with permission from The Free Thought Project\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

            "question": "Which of the following tactics is used in the following text?\n\nArticle: Patrick J. Buchanan: Sorry, Jeff Flake, It's Trump's Party Now! | Articles More is now required of us than to put down our thoughts in writing, declaimed Jeff Flake in his oration against President Trump, just before he announced he will be quitting the Senate. Though he had lifted the title of his August anti-Trump polemic, \"Conscience of a Conservative,\" from Barry Goldwater, Jeff Flake is no Barry Goldwater. Goldwater took on the GOP establishment in the primaries, voted against the Civil Rights Act of 1964, defiantly declared, \"Extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice,\" and then went down to defeat battling to the end after the assassination of JFK made LBJ invincible. The real \"Mr. Conservative\" was a true profile in courage. Flake, with only 18 percent approval in Arizona, decided to pack it in rather than get waxed in his own primary. With Falstaff, Flake appears to believe that \"discretion is the better part of valor.\" Sen. Bob Corker is another summertime soldier calling on colleagues to stand and fight Trump while he retires to Tennessee. It's no wonder the establishment is viewed with such derision. Flake calls Trump \"dangerous to our democracy.\" But the real threat Trump represents is to the GOP establishment's control of the party's agenda and the party's destiny. U.S. politics have indeed been coarsened, with Trump playing a lead role. Yet, beneath the savagery of the uncivil war in the party lies more than personal insults and personality clashes. This is a struggle about policy, about the future. And Trump is president because he read the party and the country right, while the Bush-McCain Republican establishment had lost touch with both. How could the Beltway GOP not see that its defining policies \u2014 open borders, amnesty, free trade globalism, compulsive military intervention in foreign lands for ideological ends \u2014 were alienating its coalition? What had a quarter century of Bushite free trade produced? About $12 trillion in trade deficits, $4 trillion with China alone, a loss of 55,000 plants and 6 million manufacturing jobs. We imported goods \"Made in China,\" while exporting our future. U.S. elites made China great again, to where Beijing is now challenging our strategic position and presence in Asia. Could Republicans not see the factories shutting down, or not understand why workers' wages had failed to rise for decades? What did the democracy crusades \"to end tyranny in our world\" accomplish? Thousands of U.S. dead, tens of thousands of wounded, trillions of dollars sunk, and a Mideast awash in blood from Afghanistan to Iraq, Libya, Syria and Yemen, with millions uprooted and homeless. Yet, still, the GOP establishment has not repudiated the mindset that produced this. With the Cold War over for a quarter of a century, what is the case now for America, $20 trillion in debt, going abroad in search of monsters to destroy? Consider. Bush-Obama \"open borders\" brought in tens of millions of Third World peoples, legally and illegally, to rising resistance from Americans forced to bear the economic and social costs. What was the GOP establishment's reply to the opposition to amnesty for illegals and calls for a moratorium on legal immigration, to assimilate the tens of millions already here? To call them nativists and parade their moral superiority. Flake and Corker are being beatified by the Beltway elites, and George W. Bush and John McCain celebrated for their denunciations of Trumpism. Yet no two people are more responsible for the blunders of the post-Cold War era than McCain and Bush. About which of half a dozen wars were they right? Yesterday's New York Times recognized Trump's triumph: \"Despite the fervor of President Trump's Republican opponents, the president's brand of hard-edged nationalism\u2014with its gut-level cultural appeals and hard lines on trade and immigration\u2014is taking root within his adopted party.\" Moreover, a new question arises: Can the GOP establishment believe that if Trump falls, or they bring him down, they will inherit the estate and be welcomed home like the Prodigal Son? Do they believe their old agenda of open borders, amnesty, free trade globalism and democracy-crusading can become America's agenda again? Trumpism is not a detour, after which we can all get back on the interstate to the New World Order. For though unpleasant, it is not unfair to say that if there was one desire common to Bernie Sanders, Ted Cruz and Donald Trump voters, it was be rid of the regime resting on top of all of us. Should Trump fall, and a restored establishment attempt to reimpose the old policies, there will be a truly uncivil war in this country. After the Trumpian revolt, there is no going back. As that most American of writers, Thomas Wolfe, put it, \"You can't go home again.\" Traditionalists have been told that for years. Now it's the turn of the GOP establishment to learn the truth as well. Goldwater lost badly, but the establishment that abandoned him never had its patrimony restored. It was the leaders they abhorred, Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, to whom the future belonged. Patrick J.

In an interview with Hill.TV yesterday, the president said he ordered the mass declassification to show the public that the FBI investigation of the conspiracy theory began as a \u201choax.\u201d Exposing it could be one of the \u201ccrowning achievements\u201d of his presidency, he said. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve done is a great service to the country, really,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope to be able to call this, along with tax cuts and regulation and all the things I\u2019ve done\u2026 in its own way this might be the most important thing because this was corrupt.\u201d Trump criticized how the FBI handled the Russia probe, accusing it of misleading the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court, and of spying on his campaign. \u201cThey know this is one of the great scandals in the history of our country because basically what they did is, they used [former Trump campaign aide] Carter Page, who nobody even knew, who I feel very badly for, I think he\u2019s been treated very badly. They used Carter Page as a foil in order to surveil a candidate for the presidency of the United States.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a hoax, beyond a witch hunt,\u201d Trump said. The documents affected involve a FISA warrant against Carter Page and text messages from disgraced ex-FBI employees Peter Strzok and Lisa Page. (Carter Page is not related to Lisa Page.) Although the conspiracy theory is baseless nonsense, it continues to dog the Trump administration, providing cable television news outlets and late-night talk show hosts with endless fodder in the 24-hour news cycle. When Trump defenders have fought back, social media companies have colluded with the Left to silence and intimidate them. This declassification effort won\u2019t make things any worse than they are for President Trump. It may even prove a political masterstroke of sorts for Trump. How else does one fight back against the nameless, faceless bureaucrats of the Deep State who hide behind anonymity to undermine the duly elected 45th president of the United States? Make the documents public and let the chips fall where they may. There is so much leftist dirt to uncover. For example, it was established some time ago that former President Obama was involved on some level in this shameful un-American plot to rig the 2016 election and undermine his successor by using the privacy-invading apparatus of the state. Obama wanted \u201cto know everything\u201d the FBI was doing in its investigation into claims that Russia was interfering in the 2016 election. Specifically, the statement that Obama wanted \u201cto know everything we\u2019re doing\u201d came in a private Sept. 2, 2016, text message from FBI lawyer Lisa Page to FBI agent Peter Strzok, with whom she was having an extramarital affair at the time. (The exact message, time-stamped 1:50 p.m., reads \"Yes, bc potus wants to know everything we are doing.\") In a separate text message to Page, Strzok wrote something cryptic about an \u201cinsurance policy\u201d in case Donald Trump got elected. Apparently, he was referring to the salacious, unverified dossier Hillary Clinton and the DNC paid rent-a-spy Christopher Steele to compile that purports to show Trump\u2019s nefarious links to Russia. President Trump ordered that the relevant documents be released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) and the Justice Department \u201c[a]t the request of a number of committees of Congress, and for reasons of transparency,\u201d read a statement issued by White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. Trump ordered the \u201cimmediate declassification\u201d of \u201cpages 10-12 and 17-34 of the June 2017 application to the FISA court in the matter of Carter W. Page,\u201d \u201call FBI reports of interviews with Bruce G. Ohr prepared in connection with the Russia investigation,\u201d and \u201call FBI reports of interviews prepared in connection with all Carter Page FISA applications.\u201d Trump also ordered the \u201cthe Department of Justice (including the FBI) to publicly release all text messages relating to the Russia investigation, without redaction, of James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, and Bruce Ohr.\u201d The chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Devin Nunes (R -Calif.), reportedly hailed Trump\u2019s order, saying it covers \u201cpretty much everything that he wanted \u2026 and the text messages are a bonus.\u201d A handful of Democratic lawmakers alarmed at the prospect of being exposed as frauds and publicly humiliated wrote Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, and FBI Director Christopher Wray on Tuesday. The letter, which is an attempt to usurp the powers vested in the president, asks the three agencies to defy the presidential directive. \"Your agencies' review, and any communication with the White House on the substance of the material, should not proceed further until you have briefed the Gang of Eight in person.\" It claims that Trump\u2019s declassification request constitutes improper intervention \u201cin an ongoing law enforcement investigation that may implicate the President himself or those around him.\u201d The authors of the letter even lie about the nature of the broad-based request, claiming Trump is selectively declassifying information to save himself. \u201cThe action he has taken, to direct your agencies to selectively disclose classified information that he believes he can manipulate publicly to undermine the legitimacy and credibility of the Special Counsel\u2019s [Robert Mueller] investigation, is a brazen abuse of power.\u201d The missive is signed by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), who is vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), and Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), who is ranking member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.

As The Hill pointed out earlier this morning, the latest development in this sordid tale revolves around a man that the FBI used as an informant back in 2009 and beyond to build a case against a Russian perpetrator who ultimately admitted to bribery, extortion and money laundering. The informant, who is so far only known as \u201cConfidential Source 1,\u201d says that when he attempted to come forward last year with information that linked the Clinton Foundation directly to the scandal he was promptly silenced by the FBI and the Obama administration. Working as a confidential witness, the businessman made kickback payments to the Russians with the approval of his FBI handlers and gathered other evidence, the records show. Sources told The Hill the informant\u2019s work was crucial to the government\u2019s ability to crack a multimillion dollar racketeering scheme by Russian nuclear officials on U.S. soil that involved bribery, kickbacks, money laundering and extortion. In the end, the main Russian executive sent to the U.S. to expand Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s nuclear business, an executive of an American trucking firm and a Russian financier from New Jersey pled guilty to various crimes in a case that started in 2009 and ended in late 2015. Toensing added her client has had contact from multiple congressional committees seeking information about what he witnessed inside the Russian nuclear industry and has been unable to provide that information because of the NDA. \u201cHe can\u2019t disclose anything that he came upon in the course of his work,\u201d she said. The information the client possesses includes specific allegations that Russian executives made to him about how they facilitated the Obama administration\u2019s 2010 approval of the Uranium One deal and sent millions of dollars in Russian nuclear funds to the U.S. to an entity assisting Bill Clinton\u2019s foundation. At the time, Hillary Clinton was serving as secretary of State on the government panel that approved the deal, the lawyer said. It has been previously reported that Bill Clinton accepted $500,000 in Russian speaking fees in 2010 and collected millions more in donations for his foundation from parties with a stake in the Uranium One deal, transactions that both the Clintons and the Obama administration denied had any influence on the approval. In the midst of the new discoveries revealed yesterday about the Uranium One case (see: FBI Uncovered Russian Bribery Plot Before Obama Approved Uranium One Deal, Netting Clintons Millions), \u201cConfidential Source 1\u201d has once again hired an attorney, Victoria Toensing, a former Reagan Justice Department official and former chief counsel of the Senate Intelligence Committee, to get his story out. Sitting down with The Hill earlier, Toensing said that the last time her client tried to speak out \u201cboth his reputation and liberty\u201d were \u201cthreatened\u201d by the Obama administration in a effort to force his silence. \u201cAll of the information about this corruption has not come out,\u201d she said in an interview Tuesday. \u201cAnd so my client, the same part of my client that made him go into the FBI in the first place, says, \u2018This is wrong. What should I do about it?\u2019\u201d Toensing said she also possesses memos that recount how the Justice Department last year threatened her client when he attempted to file a lawsuit that could have drawn attention to the Russian corruption during the 2016 presidential race as well as helped him recover some of the money Russians stole from him through kickbacks during the FBI probe. The undercover client witnessed \u201ca lot of bribery going on around the U.S.\u201d but was asked by the FBI to sign a nondisclosure agreement (NDA) that prevents him from revealing what he knows to Congress, Toensing explained. When he tried to bring some of the allegations to light in the lawsuit last year, \u201cthe Obama Justice Department threatened him with loss of freedom. They said they would bring a criminal case against him for violating an NDA,\u201d she added. Emails obtained by The Hill show that a civil attorney working with the former undercover witness described the pressure the Justice Department exerted to keep the client from disclosing to a federal court what he knew last summer. \u201cThe government was taking a very harsh position that threatened both your reputation and liberty,\u201d the civil lawyer wrote in one email. In another, she added, \u201cAs you will recall the gov\u2019t made serious threats sufficient to cause you to withdraw your civil complaint.\u201d As we pointed out last summer when Peter Schweizer first released his feature documentary Clinton Cash, the Uranium One deal at the center of this scandal is believed to have netted the Clintons and their Clinton Foundation millions of dollars in donations and \u2018speaking fees\u2019 from Uranium One shareholders and other Russian entities. Russian Purchase of US Uranium Assets in Return for $145mm in Contributions to the Clinton Foundation \u2013 Bill and Hillary Clinton assisted a Canadian financier, Frank Giustra, and his company, Uranium One, in the acquisition of uranium mining concessions in Kazakhstan and the United States. Subsequently, the Russian government sought to purchase Uranium One but required approval from the Obama administration given the strategic importance of the uranium assets. In the run-up to the approval of the deal by the State Department, nine shareholders of Uranium One just happened to make $145mm in donations to the Clinton Foundation. Moreover, the New Yorker confirmed that Bill Clinton received $500,000 in speaking fees from a Russian investment bank,\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

A Jewish student at McGill University has been kicked off the student government board for having \u201cconflicts of interest\u201d due to his pro-Israel activism. Third-year student Noah Lew was one of 12 board members up for general assembly ratification on Monday evening following his victory as vice-president finance of the Arts Undergraduate Society. The ratification vote is typically a mere formality, but Monday\u2019s was different due to Democratize Student Society of McGill University (SSMU), an organization that was established to resist the university\u2019s ban of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement on campus. Democratize SSMU was able to pass a motion that required each board member to be voted upon separately under the grounds that they weren\u2019t a fan of the names. When it was Lew\u2019s turn, he was voted down, 105 to 73 with 12 abstaining, with applause following the vote. Two other students who had criticized BDS, Alexander Scheffel and Josephine Wright O\u2019Manique, were also voted down. Democratize SSMU had targeted Lew and the other two students on the board because they had connections to the Canadian Jewish Political Affairs Committee (CJPAC) and were involved in getting the BDS ban passed, which Democratize SSMU claimed were \u201cconflicts of interests.\u201d Somehow I don't think being a member of a Muslim student group and supporting BDS would be considered a conflict of interest. But the campus anti-Israel crowd has been working rather hard to intimidate and penalize anyone involved in pro-Israel organizations. And to keep their racist boycott movement going by maintaining control over student governments. Lew shared the experience on Facebook. \u201cI have no doubt from the information circulated about me and campaign run against me prior to this vote that this was about my Jewish identity, and nothing more,\u201d wrote Lew. \u201cI was blocked from being able to participate in my student government because I am Jewish, because I have been affiliated with Jewish organizations, and because I believe in the right to Jewish self-determination.\u201d Lew added that the experience shows the inherent anti-Semitism in the BDS movement. \u201cIf BDS is not anti-Semitic, why did a BDS-led campaign name and shame me for my affiliation with a Jewish organization, and call on students to remove me from student government for this reason?\u201d wrote Lew. \u201cIf BDS is not anti-Semitic, why was I barred from participating in student government because of my Jewish identity?\u201d There are some more details here and a petition. On Monday night, three students were removed from the Board of Directors of the Students\u2019 Society of McGill University (SSMU), McGill\u2019s main student government. All three were targeted for removal either because they are Jewish or have vocally opposed anti-Jewish discrimination on campus. This episode is utterly unacceptable, and is merely the latest in a long string of antisemitic incidents at your university. Indeed, according to eyewitnesses, one of the members of the mob that removed the three directors was Igor Sadikov. You will remember Sadikov as the student politician who in February told his followers to \u201cpunch a Zionist today.\u201d It is unclear whether Sadikov has faced any disciplinary action for this incitement to violence from your administration. Antisemitism at McGill does not emerge from a vacuum. Rather, it has been nurtured in part by a toxic campus press, especially the McGill Daily, a publication which openly refuses to publish any \u201cZionist\u201d content. In practice, this prevents McGill\u2019s Jewish community from defending itself against the absurd attacks to which it is subjected. If the Daily is committed to systematically excluding the voices of an ethno-religious community on campus, then it cannot continue to receive automatic student funding, as it does now. The double standard here is pretty clear. And we know exactly what the reaction would be if a student paper refused to publish any pro-Islamist content.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

Popular at home but increasingly at odds politically and economically with mainstream European Union peers, Orban has thrived on external controversy, including repeated clashes with Brussels and lately the United Nations. Those conflicts, mostly centred on migration since people fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East and Africa flooded into Europe in 2015, have intensified as the elections approach and Orban poses as a saviour of Europe's Christian nations. \"Christianity is Europe's last hope,\" Orban told an audience of party faithful at the foot of the Royal Castle in Budapest. With mass immigration, especially from Africa, \"our worst nightmares can come true. The West falls as it fails to see Europe being overrun.\" Orban is widely credited for reversing an economic slump in Hungary and controlling its public finances, culminating in a return to investment-grade for its debt, which was cut to 'junk' during the 2008 global economic crisis. To achieve that and hold onto power the prime minister, 54, has used methods that critics have called authoritarian, and picked fights with EU partners, especially in the West. Eastern leaders, most notably in Poland, have followed his lead. But migration dominates his agenda now. Orban said on Sunday that Europe faces a critical fissure between nation states of the East and the West, which he called an \"immigrant zone, a mixed population world that heads in a direction different from ours\". As the West wants eastern Europe to follow its lead, an increasingly vicious struggle was likely, he said, alluding to a plan to redraw the European alliance advocated by the leaders of France and Germany. \"Absurd as it may sound the danger we face comes from the West, from politicians in Brussels, Berlin and Paris,\" Orban said to loud applause. \"Of course we will fight, and use ever stronger legal tools. The first is our 'Stop Soros' law.\" Orban has for years targeted Hungarian-born U.S. financier George Soros, whose philanthropy aims to bolster liberal and open-border values -- anathema to Orban, an advocate of a loose group of strong nation states that reject multiculturalism. The Hungarian leader has advocated \"ethnic homogeneity\" and compared Soros, a Jew, to a puppet master unleashing immigration onto Europe to undermine its cultural and economic integrity. A defining moment of his premiership came in 2015, as the migrant crisis peaked: he built a double razor wire fence that became the symbol of anti-migrant sentiment in Europe. Orban also said the Hungarian opposition had failed to heed the call of history when it opposed his toughness on migrants. Voters have responded favourably and Orban is a clear leader of all polls. POWERFUL ALLIES Orban has conflated the issue of immigration with the image of Soros, 87, whose name was used in a tough anti-migrant bill sent to Parliament on Wednesday. Soros, for his part, compared Orban unfavourably to both the Nazis and the Communists, saying his rule evoked dark tones from the 1930's -- when Hungary was allied with Nazi Germany -- and was more oppressive than Cold War Soviet occupation. Orban has tightened the screws on non-government organisations, particularly ones funded by Soros, and attempted to close a prominent Soros-founded university. Attributing to Soros a recent United Nations plan on creating a global blueprint to handle the migration crisis, Orban said he anticipated that powerful allies would help him prevent the U.N. from greasing the wheels of migration. \"Soros has antagonised not only us but also England, President Trump and Israel too,\" he said. \"Everywhere he wants to get migration accepted. It won't work. We are not alone and we will fight together ... and we will succeed.\" In Europe, he cited as allies Hungary's fellow Visegrad countries Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland, whose ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party is also often at loggerheads with the EU. He said a victory for Silvio Berlusconi's party in Italy's March 4 election would strengthen the nationalist fold. \"We don't think the fight is hopeless, on the contrary, we are winning,\" Orban said. \"The V4 is firm, Croatia has come around, Austria has turned in the patriotic direction, and in Bavaria the CSU has created a resistance.\" (Reporting by Marton Dunai; Editing by Catherine Evans) Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

Her actions were quite clearly illegal, though she claimed that she had cleared her actions with lawyers beforehand, And now, a member of the #Resistance may actually end up fighting obstruction of justice charges. Thomas Homan, the acting director of ICE, slammed Mayor Schaaf, who on Saturday night released an unprecedented warning that ICE was about to begin arresting people. Schaaf said she issued the alert after receiving confidential tips from \u201ccredible sources,\u201d and conferring with attorneys to make sure she wasn\u2019t opening herself up to federal prosecution. The mayor\u2019s move endangered ICE officers and alerted their targets, Homan asserted, \u201cmaking clear that this reckless decision was based on her political agenda.\u201d He said 864 \u201ccriminal aliens and public safety threats remain at large in the community, and I have to believe that some of them were able to elude us thanks to the mayor\u2019s irresponsible decision.\u201d Fox News, which was given a ride-along with ICE officers during the operation, reported that agency officials were asking the Department of Justice to investigate whether Schaaf broke any laws. Now the DOJ is looking into Schaaf. The Department of Justice is looking into whether Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf obstructed justice by warning Northern California residents of an impending raid by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The agency\u2019s acting director, Thomas Homan, told \u201cFox & Friends\u201d Wednesday morning that the DOJ is \u201creviewing\u201d whether Schaaf broke any laws by telling her constituents ICE would be raiding the area in order to arrest people violating federal immigration laws. Schaaf, a Democrat, posted the warning to Twitter Saturday, writing that \u201cmultiple credible sources\u201d told her the immigration agency was \u201cpreparing to conduct an operation in the Bay Area, including Oakland, starting as soon as\u201d Sunday. \u201cWhat she did is no better than a gang lookout yelling \u2018police\u2019 when a police cruiser comes in the neighborhood, except she did it to a whole community,\u201d Homan told \"Fox & Friends.\" \"There's over 800 significant public safety threat criminals ... that we are unable to locate because of that warning, so that community's a lot less safe than it would've been.\" That's exactly it.

Just like his promotion of voting for Republicans in the House would lead to defeating Democrats and keep the words \"Speaker Pelosi\" off our lips, Trump also said that a vote for Braun's opponent, incumbent Democrat Sen. Joe Donnelly, would lead to Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY) becoming the Senate Majority leader should the Democrats regain control of the Senate. The president also pointed out that Donnelly had opposed tax cuts and joined with his fellow Democrats in attacking and voting against Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court. \"The people of Indiana do not have a one-week memory,\u201d said Trump. \u201cThat was a disgrace what we watched up there.\" Additionally, Trump said that Donnelly voted to provide free health care to illegal aliens and sponsored Senator Dianne Feinstein's (D-CA) \"Open Borders Bill.\" While some don't believe that Trump's base is all that energized, it seems pretty energetic to me and attacks on conservatives on social media and in search engine results have only furthered their outrage at the establishment, both Democrat and Republican.

North Korea called his \u2018or else\u2019 bluff. Good. No action on North Korea is better than any conceivable military operation. Last week the North Korea test fired a new, longer-ranged strategic missile, Hwasong-14, that US experts claimed was capable of hitting Alaska and perhaps even San Francisco. North Korea is now believed to have mastered a lightweight nuclear warhead that can be carried by the Hwasong and shorter-ranged Taepodong and Nodong missiles. North Korea can\u2019t today seriously threaten North America with missile strikes, but it probably will by 2019. Meanwhile, North Korean nuclear and conventionally-armed missiles (and this could include poison gas and biological warheads) today threaten the 80,000 plus US military personnel based in Japan, South Korea and Guam. They would be immediate targets should the US and South Korea attack the north. American Raj: Liberati...

Half of South Korea\u2019s capitol, Seoul, is within range of North Korean heavy artillery and rocket batteries dug into the so-called Demilitarized Zone. It would take only three nuclear weapons to shatter Japan and just two to cripple South Korea, not to mention polluting the globe with radioactive dust and contaminating North Asia\u2019s water sources. Nuclear explosions would spread radioactive contamination over northern China and Pacific Russia. Why are we even talking about nuclear war in North Asia? Because North Korea has scraped and skimped for decades to build nuclear weapons for the sole reason of deterring a major US attack, including the use by the US of tactical nuclear weapons. Pakistan \u2018ate grass\u2019 for decades to afford nuclear weapons to offset the threat from far more powerful India. Israel uses the same argument to justify its large nuclear arsenal. After Washington overthrew the rulers of Iraq and Libya, it became painfully apparent that small nations without nuclear weapons were vulnerable to US \u2018regime change\u2019 operations. The North Koreans, who are very eccentric but not stupid, rushed to accelerate their nuclear weapons and delivery systems. Almost equally important, North Korea boasts one of the word\u2019s biggest armies \u2013 1,020,000 men, 88,000 crack special forces, and an trained militia of over 5 million. The North\u2019s weapons are obsolescent; its small air forces and navy will be vaporized by US power but its troops are deeply dug into the mountainous terrain and would be fighting from prepared positions. War against North Korea would be a slow and bloody slog\u2013 even a repeat of the bloody, stalemated 1950-52 Korean War in which 39,000 Americans and at least 2.5 million Koreans died. I\u2019ve been in the deep North Korean-dug tunnels under the Demilitarized Zone. A full division can be moved through in only 60 minutes. Ever since being soundly beaten in Vietnam and fought to a draw in Afghanistan, the US military has preferred to attack small countries like Panama, Grenada, Somalia, Yemen, Iraq and Syria. The Pentagon is not eager to tangle with the tough North Koreans. Estimates of the cost of a US invasion of North Korea have run as high as 250,000 US casualties and tens of billions of dollars. Seemingly heedless of these hard facts, President Trump \u2013 who himself avoided national military service in the 1960\u2019s \u2013 keeps beating the war drums over North Korea and needling its thin-skinned regime with naval exercises, over-flights, and intensifying bombast. North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong-un has played right along, clearly relishing his game of chicken with tough-talking Donald Trump. Trump seemed certain he could somehow cajole China into disarming North Korea\u2019s nuclear arsenal. But the administration\u2019s amateur foreign policymakers failed to understand that the only \u201cdeal\u201d that could get China to disarm the North was by agreeing to remove all US military bases from the region \u2013 South Korea, Japan and Guam \u2013 and also moving the US Seventh Fleet far from China\u2019s coasts.

Eric Margolis Best Price: $2.60 Buy New $24.57 (as of 06:55 EDT - Details) Growing US hysteria over North Korea, a nation of only 25 million, recalls the propaganda storm launched by Washington to justify its invasion of equally small Iraq. The dim-witted US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, has become point-woman for hurling warlike threats at North Korea even though this neocon poster-girl\u2019s foreign affairs experience appears to have been limited to the International House of Pancakes in her native South Carolina. Everyone seems to have forgotten, or ignores, that North Korea, South Korea and the United States remain in a state of war. The 1950-52 Korean War ended with a cease-fire, not a peace. The US has been trying to overthrow and undermine North Korea\u2019s Stalinist regimes ever since, using military threats, subversion and economic warfare. Talk of US-South Korean plans to \u201cdecapitate\u2019 North Korea\u2019s leadership with missile strikes and commando raids keeps giving Pyongyang the jitters. South Korea\u2019s new president, Moon Jae-in, demanded that his nation be consulted before any military action. But Moon\u2019s pleas have been largely ignored by Trump. Most South Koreans shrug off the North\u2019s threats and seek to avoid war at all costs. Of course. They would be the primary victims. The US has spent over $200 billion on ballistic anti-missile systems in recent years designed to stop North Korean missiles. Unfortunately, these ABM systems don\u2019t work very well.

            "question": "Which of the following tactics is used in the following text?\n\nArticle: Geert Wilders Puts the Political Elites On Notice Geert Wilders spoke at a massive rally for Tommy Robinson on Saturday. 20,000 people came out to call for Tommy\u2019s release, and Wilders took the opportunity to put the political elites of Britain and continental Europe on notice. \u201cOur governments,\u201d Wilders declared, \u201csold us out with mass immigration. With Islamization. With open borders. We are almost foreigners in our own lands. And if we complain about it, they call us racists and Islamophobes. But I say, no more! And what do you say? No more! And that\u2019s right: enough is enough. We will not be gagged anymore. No more tyranny.\u201d It was extraordinary that the British authorities allowed Wilders into the country at all. Several years ago he was banned from entering the country, but although the ban was reversed on appeal, the British government recently banned Martin Sellner, Brittany Pettibone, Lauren Southern and Lutz Bachmann from entering, all for the crime of opposing jihad terror and Sharia oppression, and thereby made it clear that it is more authoritarian and unwilling to uphold the freedom of speech than ever \u2013 at least when it comes to criticism of Islam, Muslim rape gangs, and mass Muslim migration. Even worse, the bannings of Sellner, Pettibone, Southern, and Bachmann were just part of a long pattern. Pamela Geller and I were banned from entering Britain in 2013, apparently for life, also for the crime of telling the truth about Islam and jihad. Meanwhile, Britain has a steadily lengthening record of admitting jihad preachers without a moment of hesitation. Syed Muzaffar Shah Qadri\u2019s preaching of hatred and jihad violence was so hardline that he was banned from preaching in Pakistan, but the UK Home Office welcomed him into Britain. The UK Home Office also admitted Shaykh Hamza Sodagar into the country, despite the fact that he has said: \u201cIf there\u2019s homosexual men, the punishment is one of five things. One \u2013 the easiest one maybe \u2013 chop their head off, that\u2019s the easiest. Second \u2013 burn them to death. Third \u2013 throw \u2019em off a cliff. Fourth \u2013 tear down a wall on them so they die under that. Fifth \u2013 a combination of the above.\u201d Theresa May\u2019s relentlessly appeasement-minded government also admitted two jihad preachers who had praised the murderer of a foe of Pakistan\u2019s blasphemy laws. One of them was welcomed by the Archbishop of Canterbury. Meanwhile, the UK banned three bishops from areas of Iraq and Syria where Christians are persecuted from entering the country. But now matters are coming to a head. Apparently British authorities decided that it would be too politically costly for them to bar Wilders again. And so he entered, and spoke, and gave them a strong dose of the reality that they are determined to ignore and deny. Tommy Robinson is in prison today because he violated a court order demanding that he not film videos outside the trials of Muslim rape gangs. Clearly the government\u2019s intent was to make sure that as few people as possible discovered the truth about its massive, years-long cover-up of those rape gangs, and refusal to prosecute the perpetrators. Theresa May and company obvious hope that other Britons who are furious about the sacrifice of thousands of British girls to the idols of \u201cdiversity\u201d and \u201cmulticulturalism\u201d will see what happened to Tommy, and be frightened into silence. The British government, in imprisoning Tommy Robinson, has shown itself willing to incarcerate people for having opinions that it considers unacceptable. That heralds the death of Britain as a free society and the beginning of an authoritarian police state there, unless this slide to totalitarianism is stopped now. British public figures, whatever criticism they have leveled against Tommy Robinson in the past, should be calling for him to be freed today, or else they will be exposing themselves as supporting the degeneration of Britain into a police state. Wilders addressed this endeavor head-on, declaring: \u201cWe will not be silenced. We will not be intimidated. And we tell the governments, we are not afraid of you. We will never surrender. We will stand strong and do our duty. We will defend our civilization. And we will protect our people.\u201d Wilders added: \u201cAnd I tell you, to the governments. You can throw us in jail, but you will never defeat us. Because, my friends, for every Tommy whom you imprison, thousands will rise up. So take notice, Theresa May. Take notice, Dutch Prime Minister Rutte. Take notice, Mrs. Merkel or President Macron. Take notice: the future is ours and not yours. We will defeat you politically, because we, my friends, we are the people.\u201d If Wilders\u2019 words don\u2019t prove true, it will be because the death of free societies in Britain and Western Europe is truly at hand.

New Horizons originally launched way back in early 2006, and it the spacecraft has made close passes of a number of planets during its more than a decade of cruising through our Solar System. Its primary mission was set to last roughly 10 years, but was extended once it became clear that the spacecraft was healthy enough to continue sending back observations for a while longer. Its new extended mission will wrap up in early 2021 after it performs a number of flybys of large objects in the Kuiper Belt that scientists want to learn more about. However, that might not be the last we hear from New Horizons, as its power source could continue to provide life into 2026 and beyond. If it makes it that long, NASA plans to use the spacecraft to study the outer heliosphere.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

In the future everyone will be the subject of social justice crybullying for 15 minutes. Also the Left killed comedy. This is what its corpse looks like. Saturday Night Live writer and comedian Nimesh Patel was pulled from the stage by event organizers after telling jokes that were criticized as racist and homophobic during his performance at cultureSHOCK: Reclaim, an event held by Columbia Asian American Alliance on Friday night. Patel, 32, was the first Indian-American writer for SNL, and has since been nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing. Patel has previously performed on Late Night with Seth Meyers and opened for comedians such as Chris Rock. During the event, Patel\u2019s performance featured commentary on his experience living in a diverse area of New York City\u2014including a joke about a gay, black man in his neighborhood\u2014which AAA officials deemed inappropriate. Patel joked that being gay cannot be a choice because \u201cno one looks in the mirror and thinks, \u2018this black thing is too easy, let me just add another thing to it.\u2019\u201d That's what Columbia snowflakes thought was offensive. I can't imagine what they would have made of Richard Pryor, or at this point even, Chris Rock. It's also a version of a Sammy Davis Jr joke about converting to Judaism. Which is now a hate crime. About 30 minutes into Patel\u2019s set, members of AAA interrupted the performance, denounced his jokes about racial identities and sexual orientation, and provided him with a few moments for closing remarks. Comrades, these jokes you have been listening to are thought crimes! Patel pushed back on the officials\u2019 remarks, and said that while he stood in solidarity with Asian American identities, none of his remarks were offensive, and he was exposing the audience to ideas that would be found \u201cin the real world.\u201d Before he could finish, Patel\u2019s microphone was cut from off-stage, and he proceeded to leave. The real world? This is Columbia. For Sofia Jao, BC \u201822, problems with the performance resided not in the set, but with Patel\u2019s closing remarks. \u201cI really dislike when people who are older say that our generation needs to be exposed to the real world. Obviously the world is not a safe space but just accepting that it\u2019s not and continuing to perpetuate the un-safeness of it\u2026 is saying that it can\u2019t be changed,\u201d said Jao. \u201cWhen older generations say you need to stop being so sensitive, it\u2019s like undermining what our generation is trying to do in accepting others and making it safer.\u201d Patel is 32.

            "question": "Which of the following tactics is used in the following text?\n\nArticle: The US Is Blatantly Telling Lies It\u2019s no secret that the Trump administration has a strong distaste for Iran. Iran is one of the only issues on which the U.S. president has remained relatively consistent. Trump berated the country both before and after taking office. However, Trump\u2019s anti-Iran strategy goes against the better judgment of even the most anti-Iranian advisors in his staff who don\u2019t want to see the U.S. isolated on the world stage. Fortunately for Trump, however, he is not alone in his bid to isolate and demonize Iran at all costs. On December 12, Trump\u2019s ambassador to the U.N., Nikki Haley, gave a grandiose speech demonizing Iran that echoed Colin Powell\u2019s infamous performance before the U.N. in 2003. Haley\u2019s essential claim was that Saudi Arabia is under attack by missiles supplied to Yemen by the Iranian government and that the world should not sit idly by as this goes on. \u201cIf we do nothing about the missiles fired at Saudi Arabia, we will not be able to stop the violence,\u201d Haley warned. \u201cThere is clear evidence that the missiles that landed on Saudi Arabia come from Iran,\u201d she said. \u201cThe evidence is undeniable. The weapons might as well have had \u2018Made in Iran\u2019 stickers all over it.\u201d Buy Gold at Discounted Prices However, even as Haley opened her mouth, many commentators could already identify a number of issues with her speech. As Common Dream\u2019s Reza Marashi explained: \u201cHaley cited a UN report in her claim regarding Iranian missile transfers to the Houthis. Of course, the UN has reached no such conclusion. Instead, a panel of experts concluded that fired missile fragments show components from an Iranian company, but they have \u2018no evidence as to the identity of the broker or supplier.\u2019 Asked about Haley\u2019s claim that Iran is the culprit, Sweden\u2019s ambassador to the UN said, \u2018The info I have is less clear.\u2019 Analysts from the U.S. Department of Defense speaking to reporters at Haley\u2019s speech openly acknowledged that they do not know the missiles\u2019 origin. Perhaps most surreal is the very same UN report cited by Haley also says the missile included a component that was manufactured by an American company. Did she disingenuously omit that inconvenient bit from her remarks, or fail to read the entire UN report? The world may never know.\u201d Regardless of the fact that Haley misrepresented the U.N. report in question, it appears the entire premise of the U.N. report is almost completely incorrect, anyway, according to former inspector Scott Ritter. Ritter writes: \u201cThe missile debris in question actually contradicts the finding of the UN panel, which held that the missiles launched against Saudi Arabia had been transferred to Yemen in pieces and assembled there by Houthi missile engineers; it is clear that the missiles in question had been in the possession of Yemen well before the Saudi Arabian-led intervention of 2015, and that their source was either Soviet or North Korean. The modification kits, on the other hand, appear to be of Iranian origin, and were transported to Yemen via Oman. The UN panel claims not to have any evidence of \u2018external missile specialists\u2019 working alongside the Houthi; indeed, the simplicity of the Burkhan 2-H modification concept is such that anyone already familiar with the SCUD-B missile system would be able to implement the required processes without outside assistance.\u201d [emphasis added] So where did the missiles come from, and who made them? According to Ritter: \u201cRather than the Iranian-manufactured Qiam-1 missiles Haley and the Saudi Arabian government claimed, the debris presented by Haley were of a modified Soviet-manufactured SCUD-B missile; the airframe and engine are original Soviet-made components, and many of the smaller parts on display bear Cyrillic (i.e., Russian) markings. The transformation to the Burkhan 2-H design required the Houthi engineers to increase the size of the fuel and oxidizer tanks, and lengthen the airframe accordingly. This is done by cutting the airframe, and welding in place the appropriate segments (this also required that the fuel supply pipe, which passes through the oxidizer tank, be similarly lengthened.) The difference in quality between the factory welds and the new welds is readily discernable. The increased fuel supply permits a longer engine burn, which in turn increases the range of the missile. The Burkhan 2-H uses a smaller warhead than the SCUD B; as such, the guidance and control section had been reconfigured to a smaller diameter, and an inter-stage section added to connect the warhead/guidance section with the main airframe.\u201d Those who have been paying attention to this conflict have been well aware that the U.S. has had little material evidence to link Yemen\u2019s Houthis to Iranian arms suppliers. In January of this year, a panel of U.N. experts stated: \u201cThe panel has not seen sufficient evidence to confirm any direct large-scale supply of arms from the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, although there are indicators that anti-tank guided weapons being supplied to the Houthi or Saleh forces are of Iranian manufacture.\u201d [emphasis added] Even if Iran were arming the Houthis, Haley\u2019s hypocritical anti-Iran rhetoric doesn\u2019t excuse the U.S. for continuing a foreign policy that essentially armed ISIS through U.S. weapons transfers, or for arming al-Qaeda\u2019s affiliate in Syria, just to name two examples of Washington\u2019s schizophrenic approach to the region. Why is the U.S. singling out Iran, especially when the Houthi rebels are sworn enemies of al-Qaeda? The issues here go much deeper than nonsensical hypocrisy. According to Ritter, the entire debacle has shown that if Saudi Arabia cannot contain the Houthi\u2019s missile capabilities, it cannot possibly hope to take on Iran, which possesses a significantly more advanced military than the Houthis do on their own. Ritter explains further: \u201cIf a relatively unsophisticated foe such as the Houthi, using Iranian-modified Soviet and North Korean missiles derived from 40-year-old technology, can evade an enemy force using the most modern combat aircraft backed up by the most sophisticated\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

McCarrick, Pineda/Maradiaga, Fr. James Larkin getting the boot in Dublin for upholding Catholic teaching on abortion\u2026 I know some people are, to put it bluntly, freaking out. The anger of the laity over the McCarrick situation is boiling over into the Twitter feed of the people we still call \u201cthe good bishops\u201d. Bishop Thomas Tobin of Providence RI, - nicknamed the \u201cGood Tobin\u201d in contrast to the \u201cBad Tobin\u201d and FrancisCardinal, Joseph Tobin of Newark \u2013 got quite an earful when he tweeted the other day, \u201cDespite the egregious offenses of a few, and despite the faults and sins we all have, I\u2019m very proud of my brother bishops and I admire and applaud the great work they do everyday for Christ and His Church.\u201d The replies haven\u2019t topped out yet, at 121, nearly all of them expressing outrage at this cavalier attitude toward the revelation that Cardinal McCarrick has been proven to be a life-long homosexual rapist and sexual predator, grooming and trapping young men and children into unwanted sexual contact; and that nearly the entire episcopate of the United States either colluded directly or kept quiet about it. It\u2019s clear that even the \u201cgood bishops\u201d have simply no idea how close they are to being bodily chucked out of their own churches by furious mobs. As I wrote elsewhere, since 2002, most Catholics know perfectly well, despite the lame whitewashing attempt, that \u201cthe US bishops gave themselves a pass\u201d on clerical sex abuse with the Dallas Charter \u201ca thing that brazenly shifted blame.\u201d And it seems that though they\u2019re still doing this, quite a few lay Catholics just aren\u2019t having it. We are seeing the final slide, the expected and inevitable result of the last 100 years. The Church was infiltrated, we know this, in the 19th century by some pretty dark forces, and they have finally come into the ascendancy and are showing themselves quite clearly for what they are. The McCarrick news \u2013 and all the stuff swirling around it like the latest about Bishop Pineda and his connection to Pope Francis through Cardinal Maradiaga \u2013 has not come in contrast to this but as an intrinsic part of it. The scandal of McCarrick is simply a toxic emission, a venting of the gasses that build up naturally around any rotting thing. Rod Dreher[1] is doing excellent work compiling testimony from priests and others saying out loud at last what many of us had known for many years about McCarrick and his gang. It has shown the world what Traditionalists have known, that it is emphatically NOT the result of one \u201cbad apple\u201d or even only a \u201cfew\u201d as the hapless \u201cconservative\u201d Bishop Tobin tried to claim on Twitter. This is the result of a mass-collusion. As our friend Steve Skojec put it the other day, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to stop pretending it\u2019s just the progressive element in the Church. The \u2018conservatives\u2019 are complicit, too.\u201d In short, as it was during his days of glory, globe trotting on the dime of the State Department, hosting presidents for dinner and inviting John Paul II and Mother Theresa to tea, so it is now: McCarrick is the face of the New Paradigm. Whether he now has to go live in obscurity in some beach house in the Caymans, it will remain true: McCarrick is the \u201cNew Church.\u201d A point that Dreher\u2019s informants have brought up needs to be made emphatic: the homosexualist cabal that is currently reported to be dominant in the Catholic hierarchy (and don\u2019t imagine this is confined to the United States or even to the English speaking world) have a well documented methodology of mutual protection-and-threat that keeps the whole apparatus afloat. In briefest and simplest possible terms, immoral or even illegal sexual activity is preferred because it leaves a man open to blackmail, to control through fear of exposure[2]. When that blackmailing culture becomes ascendant, it will always reject the morally upright as too dangerous, too difficult to control. This is why faithful seminarians are rejected and why faithful priests are harassed. As Dreher reported, When predatory gay priests run seminaries, they select on a bias for gay candidates... Gay seminarians who intend to be celibate, Sipe said, face tremendous pressure to have sex. If they slip up even once, their failure will be noted, and shared\u2026 And they will be made to understand that their lapse is remembered. Later, as a priest, predators within the priesthood have that knowledge to hold over the heads of other gay priests, to keep them silent if they ever have the desire to blow whistles. When I was covering the scandal in the early 2000s, I spoke to several, unconnected heterosexual men \u2014 priests, former priests, seminarians \u2014 who said that gay seminary rectors or diocesan officials encouraged them to take female sexual partners, so that they too would be complicit in sexual secret-keeping, and therefore no longer [be] a potential danger. Nothing in a system like that is a greater threat to the corrupt than men who are not corrupt. For many priests, one might say all good priests, this is not a sustainable situation, to say the least. I\u2019ve had quite a few conversations with priests who are now asking how to deal with it. How are they to continue to offer the sacraments in this situation? Where are they to live? How are they to maintain themselves? These are the priests who did make it through this institutional gauntlet, who remain faithful now but are still under the control of these often grossly corrupt and evil men. As men known to be incorruptible themselves, there is a big target painted on their backs.

The Washington establishment politicians act like children when they can\u2019t have their way. They kick and scream and lie and pout. President Trump is the anti-politician and when Congress continues to behave like this, he only gets more popular. President Trump nominated Bret Kavanaugh to the supreme court. He\u2019s a pro-life judge and his vote will certainly tip the scales of justice to the right. The power that the Supreme Court has, some would argue, is greater in certain aspects than that of the president himself. Perhaps that\u2019s why the 2016 election loss was so devastating to the Democrats. Trump potentially has the ability to nominate 3 Supreme Court justices during his presidency, thus shaping the laws and morals of this country for about the next 30 years. Personally, I trust very, very few politicians no matter the party that they claim. So, when a bunch of well-documented liars come out with yet another sexual assault allegation against a Trump appointee, let\u2019s just say I\u2019m skeptical and here\u2019s why: take our poll - story continues below Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?

Timing The most suspicious part of this whole situation is the timing. Christine Ford recalled the incident in 2006 She's known about this for over ten years, why come forward now? She's affiliated with the democratic party and the \u201cresist\u201d movement She hired a Clinton attorney, Lisa Banks She can produce exactly zero witnesses Any one of these (and dozens of other) circumstances by themselves are not enough to dismiss this allegation outright. However, taken together as a whole, it\u2019s far too suspicious to lend it any credibility. Ladies, you demand to be believed, no matter what. Well, when every time there's a man that you don't like running for public office or being nominated for a position, some woman crawls out from a line of protesters and makes an ambiguous-at-best claim about unwanted sexual advances, it becomes increasingly difficult to take you seriously. No, an accusation against a man who has been investigated by the FBI six times prior and has 75 women publicly vouching for his character is not going to stop this process. And guess what, next time a man is nominated to a position who really has committed a crime, people will be that much less likely to believe his accuser. Way to go! By attempting to derail this process with such a pathetic attempt at a smear campaign, you have successfully made it much easier for a real sex offender to point back at this and say, \u201clook, this is what they do\"! Women everywhere should be furious. As an outsider, a regular Joe American, this is what I see: Trump nominates a very well known, well-established judge to the supreme court. Immediately every Democrat publicly stated that they would vote No for his confirmation. On the other hand, every Republican publicly stated that they would vote Yes. Currently, there's more Republicans in Congress than Democrats, which means the guy will be confirmed. There's an election 2 months away. The Democrats think that they'll take back the majority of Congress and will thus be able to block Trump's nomination. All they have to do is delay the confirmation until after the election. So, they dig up some Trump-hating woman from Kavanaugh\u2019s past and convince her to say that he assaulted her thinking that such an allegation will surely delay the vote long enough for them to regain control of Congress. It\u2019s not difficult to see through this plan. These are the facts. This is not my opinion. Everything else is just noise.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

Mnuchin said Thursday he was pulling out of a major Saudi investment conference, known as Davos in the Desert, in the first public rebuke by the White House of the Saudi regime over the disappearance and suspected murder of a dissident Saudi journalist who lived in Virginia. Trade and finance ministers from Britain, France, Holland and other countries, the head of the International Monetary Fund, as well as CEOs of multiple major companies already had withdrawn in protest, and Mnuchin was under growing pressure to add his name to the list. Mnuchin tweeted the decision after meeting with President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo at the White House. Pompeo later told reporters that he had urged the president to give the Saudi government \u201ca few more days\u201d to explain what happened to Jamal Khashoggi, who vanished after he entered the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, on Oct. 2. Turkish authorities and media have said audio recordings show that Khashoggi was tortured and beheaded inside the consulate, although the recordings have not been released. Khashoggi wrote opinion columns for the Washington Post critical of the Saudi royal family. Saudi King Salman and his son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the country\u2019s de facto ruler, have denied to both Trump and Pompeo any knowledge of the alleged murder or having ordered it. Pompeo returned Wednesday night from meetings with Saudi and Turkish leaders in Riyadh and Ankara and went to the White House Thursday morning to brief Trump, who has come under mounting pressure from Congress and rights groups to punish Saudi Arabia. Pompeo said the Saudis \u201cunderstand the serious nature\u201d of Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance, and would conduct a thorough and \u201ctimely\u201d investigation. Their findings, Pompeo said, \u201cwill be transparent for everyone to see, to ask questions about, to inquire with respect to its thoroughness.\u201d He said he told the president \u201cthat we ought to give them a few more days to complete that so that we too have a complete understanding of the facts\u201d before making decisions on how the U.S. should respond. Turkey is conducting its own probe, and Pompeo said those results will also be taken into consideration. He again stressed the importance of Saudi Arabia as a strategic ally, in a relationship, he noted, that dates back more than 80 years. The administration\u2019s reluctance to condemn the Saudi government has fueled criticism from Democrats and Republicans in Congress, from diplomats and from even some corporations that long have profited from close relations with the Saudi royal family. \u201cWe just are going to allow the process to move forward, allow the facts to unfold,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cAnd as they unfold, as we make a determination for ourselves about what happened there, based on the facts that are presented to us, the United States will determine what the appropriate response might be.\u201d \u2014 Tracy Wilkinson Los Angeles Times \u2014\u2014\u2014 \u00a92018 Los Angeles Times, Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s outstanding performance at yesterday\u2019s evidentiary hearing featuring attempted rape accuser Christine Blasey Ford may have revived his embattled nomination for the highest court in America. The meeting of the Senate Judiciary Committee showed the underhanded tactics employed by the Left against Judge Kavanaugh. The nominee and Republican senators used the opportunity to attack desperate Democrats for their efforts at character assassination. President Trump was delighted. \u201cJudge Kavanaugh showed America exactly why I nominated him[,]\u201d President Trump tweeted at 6:46 p.m. after the hearing wrapped up. \u201cHis testimony was powerful, honest, and riveting. Democrats\u2019 search and destroy strategy is disgraceful and this process has been a total sham and effort to delay, obstruct, and resist. The Senate must vote!\u201d Ford, who claims Kavanaugh tried to rape her decades ago when he was a high school student, appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee for several hours Thursday. Kavanaugh testified separately after Ford\u2019s testimony concluded. Kavanaugh stole the show. The judge forcefully stood up for himself as his voice trembled with righteous indignation, calling out Democratic senators for plotting against him. The behavior of several of the Democratic members of this committee at my hearing a few weeks ago was an embarrassment. But at least it was just a good old-fashioned attempt at Borking. Those efforts didn't work. When I did at least okay enough at the hearings that it looked like I might actually get confirmed, a new tactic was needed. Some of you were lying in wait and had it ready. This first allegation was held in secret for weeks by a Democratic member of this committee, and by staff. It would be needed only if you couldn't take me out on the merits. When it was needed, this allegation was unleashed and publicly deployed over Dr. Ford's wishes. And then, and then as no doubt was expected, if not planned, came a long series of false last-minute smears designed to scare me and drive me out of the process before any hearing occurred. Afraid of their own shadows, committee Republicans didn\u2019t relish the prospect of their all-male team of 11 senators questioning a woman so they hired sex-crimes prosecutor Rachel Mitchell of Maricopa County, Arizona, to examine Ford. Opinions differ widely on how Mitchell performed. She tiptoed around the alleged sexual assault itself, instead focusing on process-related questions, presumably in an effort to show undecided senators how Ford and her handlers have been unfairly manipulating the process. In much of her testimony, Ford came across as presentable and seemingly credible, though vague and sometimes evasive, her ridiculous overall story notwithstanding. Ford did well enough that during the break between her testimony and Kavanaugh\u2019s, commentators on Fox News such as Brit Hume and Andrew Napolitano were openly musing about the nominee withdrawing, opinions that were sharply reversed after the nominee completed his testimony hours later. It\u2019s not that Mitchell did a bad job creating an inventory of the irregularities in the process and of the odd behavior of Ford and her lawyers. She could do little else. She had many restrictions placed upon her and was only allowed to question Ford for minutes at a time before surrendering the floor to the next committee Democrat. As commentator Sean Davis tweeted: \u201cHard to do much else when the witness conveniently has no corroborating evidence, no memory of any verifiable facts of what happened, and everyone she says was present at the alleged incident--even her best friend--has denied it.\u201d Nonetheless, Mitchell\u2019s questioning came across at times as perfunctory, leading many observers to conclude that Republicans threw away a valuable opportunity by using her as a stand-in. She failed to lay a glove on a witness whose implausible, internally contradictory story cried out for vigorous cross-examination. In the end the too-deferential, easygoing Mitchell failed to provide much, if anything, in the way of evidence against Ford or in favor of Kavanaugh. Whether her work will bring over fence-sitting senators to Kavanaugh\u2019s side remains to be seen. Like other Democrats, Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii tried to help Ford, lobbing her softballs. After saying she thought she knew what Mitchell was trying to get at in her questions, the senator said, \u201cso I'll just ask you very plainly, Dr. Ford, is there a political motivation for your coming forward with your account of the assault by Brett Kavanaugh?\u201d \u201cNo, and I'd like to reiterate that again, I was trying to get the information to you while there was still a list of other what looked like equally-qualified candidates,\u201d Ford replied. When Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) asked Ford \u201cwith what degree of certainty do you believe Brett Kavanaugh assaulted you?\u201d Ford replied, \u201cone hundred percent.\u201d Strangely, Ford has a bad long-term memory and a bad short-term memory. She doesn\u2019t know when or where the alleged incident took place, yet she is \u201cone hundred percent\u201d certain it was Kavanaugh who attacked her. At the outset of the hearing, Grassley provided an overview of what Kavanaugh had gone through \u2013including the Democrats\u2019 sordid behavior\u2014 since President Trump announced the judge\u2019s nomination on July 9. As part of the confirmation process, Kavanaugh endured his sixth background investigation since 1993. \u201cNowhere in any of these six FBI reports, which committee investigators have reviewed on a bipartisan basis, was there a whiff of any issue \u2013 any issue at all related in any way to inappropriate sexual behavior,\u201d Grassley said. Ford shared her allegations in a letter to the committee\u2019s ranking member, Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), in the summer. The letter remained secret from July 30 through until September 13 when he first learned about it, the chairman said. Instead of sharing the letter with the committee, Feinstein did nothing. Before the hearing, Kavanaugh met privately with 65 senators, including Feinstein, who didn\u2019t ask him about the allegations when she met with him in August. The committee held a four-day public hearing from\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

However, over the past 54 years, a deluge of information and government officials have come forward showing that most everything the government and the media told Americans about the Gulf of Tonkin was a lie. Often, the American mainstream media becomes a de facto government employee, taking the claims of U.S. officials and reporting them as proven fact \u2014 and nothing exemplifies this penchant better than reporting on the Gulf of Tonkin incident \u2014 perhaps one of most flagrant lies ever dreamed up as a justification for war. According to the widely discredited official story, on August 2, 1964, the destroyer USS Maddox, while performing a signals intelligence patrol as part of DESOTO operations, was pursued by three North Vietnamese Navy torpedo boats of the 135th Torpedo Squadron. The North Vietnamese torpedo boats then attacked with torpedoes and machine gun fire. take our poll - story continues below Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?

Two days later, according to the official story, on August 4, 1962, the NSA reported that a second Gulf of Tonkin incident occurred and US ships were attacked once again. The next day, without question, on August 5, 1964, the New York Times reported \u201cPresident Johnson has ordered retaliatory action against gunboats and \u2018certain supporting facilities in North Vietnam\u2019 after renewed attacks against American destroyers in the Gulf of Tonkin.\u201d Additional outlets, such as the Washington Post, echoed this claim. The outcome of these two incidents was the passage by Congress of the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which granted then-President Lyndon B. Johnson the authority to assist any Southeast Asian country whose government was considered to be jeopardized by \u201ccommunist aggression.\u201d The resolution served as Johnson\u2019s legal justification for deploying U.S. conventional forces and the commencement of open warfare against North Vietnam. As a result, 58,177 Americans would lose their lives. Additionally, over one million North and South Vietnamese, including 627,000 civilians would be slaughtered. But it wasn\u2019t true. At all. In fact, the Gulf of Tonkin incident, as it became known, turned out to be a fictitious creation courtesy of the government to escalate war in Vietnam \u2014 leading to the deaths of tens of thousands of U.S. troops and millions of Vietnamese, fomenting the largest anti-war movement in American history, and tarnishing the reputation of a nation once considered at least somewhat noble in the eyes of the world. The truth of the matter was that the Maddox was engaged in an aggressive intelligence gathering operation working hand in hand in coordinated attacks on North Vietnam by the South Vietnamese navy and the Laotian air force. When the government announced that it had been the victim of an unprovoked attack\u2014this was a lie. In the 2003 documentary The Fog of War , the former United States Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara admitted that the August 4 Gulf of Tonkin attack never happened. In 1995, McNamara met with former Vietnam People\u2019s Army General V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p to ask what happened on August 4, 1964 in the second Gulf of Tonkin Incident. \u201cAbsolutely nothing\u201d, Gi\u00e1p replied. Gi\u00e1p claimed that the attack had been imaginary. In 2010, more than 1,100 transcripts from the Vietnam era were released, proving Congress and officials raised serious doubts about the information fed to them by the Pentagon and White House. But while this internal grumbling took place, mainstream media dutifully reported official statements as if the veracity of the information couldn\u2019t be disputed. Tom Wells, author of the exhaustive expos\u00e9 \u201cThe War Within: America\u2019s Battle Over Vietnam ,\u201d explained the media egregiously erred in \u201calmost exclusive reliance on U.S. government officials as sources of information\u201d and \u201creluctance to question official pronouncements on \u2018national security issues.\u2019\u201d If due diligence had been performed, and reporters had raised appropriate doubts about the Gulf of Tonkin false flag, it\u2019s arguable whether support for the contentious war would have lasted as long as it did and over a million lives would\u2019ve been saved. Now, retired military officials\u2014who pay attention to history\u2014are even warning about more staged events to pull us into war. \u201cI think the president needs to watch carefully for the potential for something like the Gulf of Tonkin incident,\u201d Col. Macgregor said. \u201cMany of your viewers may not remember that it never happened and we could very well be treated to something like that in the Gulf. We should watch for that, and this is an example of President Trump\u2019s comments on fake news, he should not be sabotaged by fake news.\u201d Indeed, as TFTP has reported at length, nearly all wars in US history have been started over false information.

May job numbers released Friday show native-born Americans big winners and immigrants (legal and illegal, the Labor Department doesn\u2019t distinguish) big losers. But displacement and immigrant workforce growth are still high in absolute terms and could resume anytime. Only legislation, above all an immigration moratorium, can secure the fruits of the current economic expansion for Americans. In May: Immigrant employment fell by 1.068 million, down by 3.81%. Native-born American employment rose by 1.361 million\u2014up 1.1% The immigrant employment index, set to 100.0 in January 2009, fell to 124.7 from 129.6 in April. The native-born American employment index rose to 106.6 from 105.4 in April. The New VDARE American Worker Displacement Index (NVDAWDI), our term for the ratio of immigrant to native-born employment growth indexes, fell to 117.0 from the all-time high,123.0, recorded in April. Can't render, error In other words, Trump has not even begun to repair the damage done by eight years of Obama. Native-born American workers lost ground to their foreign-born competitors throughout the Obama years. And, shown above, this trend accelerated significantly in the months leading up to the election. While May was a welcome respite, Trump supporters have reason to complain: Since taking office in January 2017 President Trump has presided over a labor market in which immigrants have gained 1.006 million jobs, a 3.9% increase, while native-born Americans gained about 2.4 million jobs \u2014a rise of only 1.9%. As far as the labor market is concerned, \u201cAmerica First\u201d has not translated to Americans First. In normal times, this might be a big story. But the even the conservative non-Main Stream Media is currently too steeped in economic euphoria to notice. Nd anyway, they almost never report the immigration dimension. However, it is now absolutely clear that immigration, and immigrant displacement of American workers, cannot be jawboned away. The only answer is legislation\u2014 border wall to stop the illegal alien flow; a second Operation Wetback, including E-Verify, to get the illegal alien self-deporting; a moratorium on legal immigration. May 2018 was the fifth consecutive month in which the foreign-born working age population (including illegals) grew by more than 1 million from the same month the prior year. But May\u2019s growth was less than that in April and March, possibly an emerging trend. Can't render, error In May 2018 there were 1.342 million more working-age immigrants than in May 2017. This comes on the heels of gains of 2.154 million and 1.597 million. year-over-year, in March and April, respectively. It\u2019s hard to believe with the evaporation of the Trump Effect, but less than six months ago we were seeing to year-over-year declines in the immigrant workforce population. The last five months of 2017 saw the foreign-born population fall by an average 100,000 from the same month of the prior year (shown in red on our chart). These are net figures. Over a 12-month period an average of perhaps 300,000 immigrants die and an equal number leave the U.S. voluntarily. So the 1.342 million net rise in foreign-born population, May 2017 to May 2018, implies that nearly 2 million foreign-born individuals may have actually settled in the country over those 12 months. (This excludes tourists and other short-term entrants.) In percentage terms, the immigrant working-age population grew 3.24% over the 12 months. If this growth rate persists, it portends a doubling in 22 years. By contrast, the native-born American population rose 0.63% over this period \u2014a rate that will require 114 years for a doubling. If both rates persist that long, the term \u201cnative born\u201d will refer to a minuscule fraction of the U.S. population. Another way of looking at American worker displacement: the immigrant share of total U.S. employment: Can't render, error Immigrants accounted for 17.36% of total employment in May. Note that, while significantly below the all-time high of 18.1% recorded in April, the May figure is third highest among the 113 months for which we have data. A detailed snapshot of American worker displacement over the past year is available in the Employment Status of the Civilian Population by Nativity table published in the monthly BLS Report.

Acosta has disputed the accusation claiming he never put his hands on the young woman. Watching the full exchange it is obvious that President Trump was making a sincere effort to answer Acosta\u2019s questions, the president actually took the time to answer three of his questions before rightfully losing his patients when Acosta refused to hand the mic over.

Pamela Geller and I are banned from entering the country for the crime of telling the truth about Islam and jihad. According to Breitbart, \u201cSellner, who described the detention centre as looking akin to a typical American prison, said he was told by authorities that his speaking at Hyde Park could cause violence and disrupt community cohesion.\u201d That\u2019s just what they claimed about Pamela Geller and me: that our visit could cause violence and disrupt community cohesion. But we, of course, have never advocated or approved of any violence. The UK Home Office meant that our visit could cause violence from Muslims. They were bowing to jihadist intimidation. Meanwhile, Britain has a steadily lengthening record of admitting jihad preachers without a moment of hesitation. Syed Muzaffar Shah Qadri\u2019s preaching of hatred and jihad violence was so hardline that he was banned from preaching in Pakistan, but the UK Home Office welcomed him into Britain. The UK Home Office also admitted Shaykh Hamza Sodagar into the country, despite the fact that he has said: \u201cIf there\u2019s homosexual men, the punishment is one of five things. One \u2013 the easiest one maybe \u2013 chop their head off, that\u2019s the easiest. Second \u2013 burn them to death. Third \u2013 throw \u2019em off a cliff.

One of them was welcomed by the Archbishop of Canterbury. Nor does the UK admit only preachers of jihad terror. It admits jihad terrorists as well, even when it knows they are jihad terrorists.

Ford has accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of attempting to force himself onto her during at a high school party nearly four decades ago, prompting prominent Democrats to get behind Ford\u2019s allegations. \u201cNo, they don\u2019t,\u201d Monahan tweeted in response to a question whether the party believes women\u2019s stories. \u201cI\u2019ve been smeared, threatened, isolated from my own party. I provided medical records from 2017, stating on two different Dr. Visits, I told them about the abuse and who did it. My therapist released records stating I have been dealing and healing from the abuse.\u201d She added: \u201cFour people, including my supervisor at the time, stated that I came to them after and shared the exact story I shared publicly, I shared multiple text between me and Keith, where I discuss the abuse with him and much more. As I said before, I knew I wouldn\u2019t be believed.\u201d Her comment came after another user pointed to comments made by Peter Daou, a Democratic strategist and former advisor to Hillary Clinton and John Kerry, who wrote in a tweet that the Kavanaugh accuser will be \u201cattacked, smeared, and demonized\u201d and that people must \u201cbelieve women.\u201d Many other Democrats and progressives \u2013 who stayed silent when the accusations against Ellison emerged \u2013 came out in support of Ford, including Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Tom Perez, chairman of the DNC, who urged to investigate the claims and Kavanaugh. Monahan went to reiterate that her story has nothing to do with politics. \u201cI have nothing to prove to anyone, I simply shared my story. People can believe it or not. I don\u2019t need anyone to affirm my humanity, I affirmed it,\u201d she wrote in another tweet. \u201cThe fact that both parties only care if it scores political points is hypocritical,\u201d she added. \u201cDo you think a person who has dealt with any form of abuse by politicians is thinking about politics? No, we & are families are trying to heal.\u201d Article posted with permission from Pamela Geller\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

            "question": "Which of the following tactics is used in the following text?\n\nArticle: France Gives Muslim Killer of Elderly Jewish Woman a Pass Every other Muslim terrorist or killer in Europe has his actions blamed on mental illness or drug use. This just continues the pattern. I wrote about the murder of Sarah Halimi last year. Sarah Lucy Halimi was thrown out of the window of the third floor Paris apartment while she begged her Muslim killer to spare her life. The 66-year-old director of an Orthodox Jewish nursery was woken from her sleep when she was violently beaten by her twenty something Muslim neighbor who then dragged her to the window. She died on the street outside the building where she had lived for thirty years. The killer had allegedly shouted, \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d. In the tragic comedy of denial that every Islamic terrorism investigation inevitably becomes, the authorities are still hunting around for his motiv Yonathan Halimi, Sarah Lucy\u2019s son, describes the killer\u2019s family as being known for its anti-Semitism. \"One day, one of the killer's sisters pushed my sister down the stairs, and the next time she called her a dirty Jew,\" he described. Sarah\u2019s brother said that the killer called Sarah and her daughter, \u201cdirty Jews\u201d. The authorities stonewalled at every turn. And, predictably, the killer gets a pass. Allahu Akbar usually means motive unknown. The 28-year-old Muslim man confessed to the killing and was heard shouting \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d and calling Halimi \u201cSatan\u201d shortly before throwing her out the window of her three-story apartment. In January, Traore was determined to be fit to stand trial. He was placed in a psychiatric hospital for weeks after his arrest in the April 2017 killing despite having no history of mental illness. But a judge requested a second series of tests, which determined that the Malian immigrant was not able to stand trial, 20 Minutes reported Wednesday. This tired farce has dragged on. Kobili Traore was hit with hate crimes charges. Then they were dropped. The authorities allowed him to commit the crime. Now they're letting him get away with it. Three minutes later, a unit of the Anti-Crime Brigade (BAC) \u2014 who happened to be patrolling the area \u2014 took up position in front of Diara\u2019s door. They heard Kobili Traore chanting Muslim prayers and Koranic verses. Unsure about the situation and the potential threats to the family, they asked for reinforcements. Additional policemen arrived quickly. However, for some unclear reason, the BAC unit still refrained from breaking in. In the meantime, Kobili Traore put on new clothes and climbed out of the window to reach Sarah Halimi\u2019s apartment, which was at the same level as Diara Traore\u2019s. He allegedly assaulted the Jewish woman and hit her mercilessly. From time to time he resumed Koranic recitation. Many neighbours, woken by the old woman\u2019s screams or the assaulter\u2019s religious chanting, called the police Some gave details about the exact location of the assault, the attacker\u2019s identity, the fact he vilified his victim as a Jewish person and as \u201ca Satan\u201d while hitting her, or even \u2014 as far as the Muslim neighbours were concerned \u2014 the Koranic portions he chanted. Yet the police still failed to storm Sarah Halimi\u2019s apartment and rescue her. Eventually, Kobili Traore is claimed to have shouted that the woman was \u201cmad and about to commit suicide\u201d, and threw her out of the window. He had time enough to climb back to Diara Traore\u2019s apartment where he finally was arrested. His hands were covered in blood. There was blood everywhere in his victim\u2019s apartment. Sure he was crazy. So crazy he tried to contrive an alibi for his crime. Kobili isn't crazy. But the system that keeps on protecting him is.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

Now, a congressman is saying there is \"credible evidence\" of \"terrorist infiltration through the southern border\" that is related to the Las Vegas shooting. If you recall, the Islamic State has never claimed responsibility for attacks they were not involved in. Here are just a few of those claims. In Naba 100 #ISIS featured an infographic on #LasVegas attack & indicated the shooter, \"Abu Abdul Barr al-Amriki,\" converted 6 months ago pic.twitter.com/5JhMFbU2Se \u2014 SITE Intel Group (@siteintelgroup) October 5, 2017 On Thursday evening, Representative Scott Perry (R-PA) appeared on Tucker Carlson tonight and said that he has evidence that the Islamic State may be telling the truth and that they may actually have been involved in the deadly attack. Perry brought up the fact that we can't seem to get information in the case that the public needs to be made aware of, something that was brought up in a district courtroom earlier this week. Additionally, the family of Stephen Paddock just received his cremated remains on Thursday and his brother said that the family has yet to receive an autopsy report. Why is that? Everyone who was killed that night had autopsies and those have been released. We're told Paddock shot himself in the head, right? Why would the autopsy report be something that needs to be withheld from the public or his family? \"Recently I\u2019ve been made aware of what I believe to be credible evidence regarding potential terrorist infiltration through the southern border regarding this incident,\" Perry said. \"Twice before the attack, ISIS warned the United States they would attack Las Vegas,\" he added. \"In June and August.\" \"And then after the attack claimed responsibility four times,\" Perry continued. \"Something\u2019s not adding up.\" \"I\u2019m just telling you I have received what I feel to be and believe to be credible evidence of a possible terrorist nexus,\" Perry said. The investigation has been conducted by local and state police, not the feds, and yet, they continue to claim there is not Islamic terrorist involvement. Yet, though they claim that Paddock was a lone gunman, they continue to withhold video of him in Mandalay Bay because they are still investigating other suspects to charge in the shooting. And no one seems to know where alleged Mandalay Bay security guard Jesus Campos is either. None of this is really that surprising. If you recall, we reported on Islamic terrorists settling into Mexico and crossing the border some years back and that came out as the infamous \"Gang of Eight\" were working on an immigration deal and had rejected building the 700 miles of double-tier border fencing Congress authorized just seven years ago, with a majority of the Senate saying they didn't want to delay granting illegal immigrants legal status while the fence was being built. Three years prior to that report, there was a video report that seems to have provided a bit of evidence to the claim that Islamists were crossing our southern border. And even though Islamic jihadis have been apprehended on our border in 2014, the Homeland Security waved their hand and said, \"There's no threat.\" In fact, DHS had denied Muslim terrorists were crossing the border, but a local investigator produced evidence to the contrary. Reports indicated that some jihadis were paying as much as $50,000 to get across the border. This has been documented for several years now. It's not surprising. What is surprising is the level of secrecy surrounding the Las Vegas shooting and the containment of information more than three months after it occurred.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

The same FBI that gave Hillary Clinton a pass for operating an illegal email server, which we have evidence for the fact that she sent and received classified documents through resulting in a national security breach and at least one death, but would not give the same leniency to Saucier who simply took some pictures of his submarine.

His lawyer, Ronald Daigle, told Fox News on Monday that the lawsuit, which he expects to file soon in Manhattan, will name the U.S. Department of Justice, former FBI Director James Comey and former President Barack Obama as defendants, among others. \u201cThey interpreted the law in my case to say it was criminal,\u201d Saucier told Fox News, referring to prosecuting authorities in his case, \u201cbut they didn\u2019t prosecute Hillary Clinton. Hillary is still walking free. Two guys on my ship did the same thing and weren\u2019t treated as criminals. We want them to correct the wrong.\u201d Daigle said that a notice about the pending lawsuit was sent to the Department of Justice and others included in it in December. There is usually a six-month period that must lapse before the lawsuit actually is filed. \u201cWe\u2019ll highlight the differences in the way Hillary Clinton was prosecuted and how my client was prosecuted,\u201d Daigle said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeking to cast a light on this to show that there\u2019s a two-tier justice system and we want it to be corrected.\u201d Saucier's attorneys attempted to use the Hillary Clinton defense to get him out of hot water for taking pictures of classified systems aboard the USS Alexandria in 2009. Prosecutors sloughed off the defense, saying it was essentially \u201cgrasping at highly imaginative and speculative straws in trying to further draw a comparison to the matter of Secretary Hillary Clinton based upon virtually no understanding and knowledge of the facts involved, the information at issue, not to mention any issues if intent and knowledge.\u201d Saucier confessed to taking photos of the submarine back in 2009 when he served as a 22-year-old machinist mate, saying he wanted to show the pictures to his family and future children. Following an interview with the FBI in 2012, he destroyed all evidence of the pictures, meaning the Naval Criminal Investigative Service could not confirm his claims that he did not share the photos with unauthorized people. \u201cIt was a foolish mistake by a very young man,\u201d Saucier\u2019s lawyer, Greg Rinckey, said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very sad case because Kristian Saucier is a fine young man. We don\u2019t believe this was really his true character.\u201d \u201cMy case was usually something handled by military courts,\u201d Saucier said. \u201cThey used me as an example because of [the backlash over] Hillary Clinton,\u201d he continued, alleging his life was ruined for political reasons. President Trump had spoken of his support of Saucier on the campaign trail and blasted the Obama administration's handling of his case. \u201cWith a pardon, there\u2019s no magic wand that gets waved and makes everything right,\u201d Saucier said, \u201cBut I try to stay positive and look forward.\u201d That's a good attitude considering he has had his cars repossessed and is in a tremendous amount of debt due to his incarceration and now having a felony on his record. But hey, Hillary is free, right? That's all that matters, cause after all, they're (Bill and Hillary) good people, aren't they, Mr. President? I think it's great that Mr. Saucier has been pardoned, I really do, but I continue to ask what a lot of Americans continue to ask, why does the known criminal Hillary Clinton remain at large in our country with her corrupt foundation taking in billions, her trashing our Republic and continuing to have a national voice?

            "question": "Which of the following tactics is used in the following text?\n\nArticle: Newt Gingrich: The truth about Trump, Putin, and Obama President Trump\u2019s summit Monday with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki created a firestorm of controversy. President Trump seemed to be publicly siding with the Russian dictator against the American intelligence agencies. The initial appearance was so bad that I tweeted: \u201cPresident Trump must clarify his statements in Helsinki on our intelligence system and Putin. It is the most serious mistake of his presidency and must be corrected \u2013 immediately.\u201d After flying home from Helsinki and reviewing the tape and transcript of his press conference with Putin, President Trump said he has \u201cfull faith and support for America\u2019s great intelligence agencies\u201d and that he accepts \u201cour intelligence community\u2019s conclusion that Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election took place.\u201d In his remarks to members of Congress Tuesday that were televised by the media, President Trump went on to admit that he realized he needed to clarify his statements in Helsinki. The president said: \u201cIt should have been obvious \u2013 I thought it would be obvious \u2013 but I would like to clarify, just in case it wasn\u2019t. In a key sentence in my remarks, I said the word \u2018would\u2019 instead of \u201cwouldn\u2019t.\u201d The sentence should have been: I don\u2019t see any reason why I wouldn\u2019t \u2013 or why it wouldn\u2019t be Russia. So just to repeat it, I said the word \u2018would\u2019 instead of \u2018wouldn\u2019t\u2019 \u2026 \u201cI have, on numerous occasions, noted our intelligence findings that Russians attempted to interfere in our elections. Unlike previous administrations, my administration has and will continue to move aggressively to repeal any efforts \u2013 and repel \u2013 we will stop it, we will repel it \u2013 any efforts to interfere in our elections. We\u2019re doing everything in our power to prevent Russian interference in 2018.\u201d Anyone who has studied President Trump knows he hates to admit a mistake. His natural pattern is to move forward and ignore mistakes. For him, this was a big correction (and as I noted the day before, it was an absolutely necessary one). President Trump then reminded everyone of the Obama administration\u2019s failures in dealing with Russian meddling in the election. President Trump noted that President Obama and his advisers had information that the Russians had been working to interfere in the election and they ignored it, because they thought Hillary Clinton was going to win. President Trump said: \u201cPresident Obama, along with (then-CIA Director John) Brennan and (then Director of National Intelligence James) Clapper and the whole group that you see on television now \u2013 probably getting paid a lot of money by your networks \u2013 they knew about Russia\u2019s attempt to interfere in the election in September, and they totally buried it. And as I said, they buried it because they thought that Hillary Clinton was going to win. It turned out it didn\u2019t happen that way. \u201cBy contrast, my administration has taken a very firm stance \u2013 it\u2019s a very firm stance \u2013 on a strong action. We\u2019re going to take strong action to secure our election systems and the process.\u201d There are two key facts in this statement. First, the very people who have been loudest in attacking President Trump about his performance at the Helsinki summit are the people who failed to protect America from Russian meddling in 2016. The very intensity and nastiness of former CIA Director Brennan and former Director of National Intelligence Clapper is an attempt to distract attention from their failure to protect America. It was their duty in 2016 \u2013 not candidate Trump\u2019s. Second, the Trump administration has been far tougher on Russia than President Obama ever dreamed of being. The Trump administration is taking real actions designed to weaken Russia and force Putin to change his aggressive behavior. The Trump administration has levied tough sanctions on Russia. Also, President Trump\u2019s public lecture about Germany not buying natural gas from Russia was aimed at cutting Putin off from hard currency worth tens of billions of dollars and further weakening the Russian economy. Furthermore, President Trump\u2019s efforts to get our European allies to increase their defense spending has a direct impact on Putin. The stronger NATO is, the less maneuvering room Russia has. Beyond pressuring our allies, consider these specific steps President Trump has taken against Russia: Where President Obama refused to provide serious weapons to the Ukrainians to help them defend themselves (his response was weakness on a pathetic scale), President Trump has approved the sale of offensive weapons to enable the Ukrainians to increase the cost of Russian aggression. When the Russians used chemical weapons in Great Britain, President Trump joined our allies and expelled 60 Russian intelligence officers from the United States. When the Russians retaliated, the Trump administration closed the Russian consulate in Seattle. President Trump had previously shuttered the Russian consulate in San Francisco and smaller annexes in Washington and New York. More than 100 Russian individuals and companies have been sanctioned for a variety of reasons. Despite the hysteria of the left, it is impossible to see the Trump administration as anything but firm in its dealing with Russia. Nothing done in Helsinki made life easier for the Putin regime in its continued economic decay and diplomatic isolation due to the sanctions regime. Finally, a brief word about the strong language and vicious comments about the president. We are in the early stages of a cultural civil war in which the left sees itself losing. This is what led me to write my new New York Times best-selling book, \u201cTrump\u2019s America: The Truth About Our Nation\u2019s Great Comeback.\u201d With each passing month the radical-extremist wing of the Democratic Party dominates the progressive wing more and more. With President Trump\u2019s nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, it was clear that anyone Trump nominated was going to be attacked.

Among the documents to be declassified are all of the text messages between disgraced FBI figures Peter Strzok and Lisa Page. The documents to be declassified include all FBI reports on interviews with Justice Department official Bruce Ohr and all FBI reports of interviews prepared in connection with all other applications to surveil Carter Page. Trump also asked that other important documents be declassified as well, including 21 pages worth of an application for a renewed surveillance warrant against former campaign aide Carter Page, according to Fox News. The 21 pages Trump wants to be declassified only make up a small part of the 412 pages of FISA applications and warrants related to Page released by the FBI earlier this year in heavily redacted format. The June 2017 application was the last of four filed by the Justice Department in support of FISA court orders allowing the monitoring of Page for nearly a year. According to the redacted version as reported by Fox News, three of the declassified pages contain information included in a section titled \u201cThe Russian Government\u2019s Coordinated Efforts to Influence the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election.\u201d That section includes reference to the potential coordination between people associated with Trump\u2019s campaign and the alleged Russian election interference effort.

Carter Page told Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity on Monday night that the FBI\u2019s investigation was \u201cso incredibly stupid to begin with.\u201d He added, \u201cMy biggest concern is all the damage that this did to the U.S. government [and] the mockery it made out of the Constitution and all of the wrongdoing that was done by various officials within the Department of Justice, the FBI and the DNC [Democratic National Committee].\u201d It is so far unknown when these documents will be declassified in an unredacted version, but it is safe to say that Democrats are probably panicking right about now. Fox News further reported that a source familiar with the timing of the declassification told the media outlet that they expected the Carter Page warrant application to be declassified first, followed by the FBI reports on agent interviews with Ohr.

The comparison of the Soros funded group that has stood with Hamas over Israel with Jews who were forced to collaborate with the Nazis during the Holocaust was indeed insulting. To Kapos. Jews under Nazi rule may have been forced to collaborate. No one forced J Street to collaborate with anti-Semites. And here's J Street trying to decide whether to stop endorsing a Democrat who pals around with Farrakhan and defended him by mentioning the \"Jewish question.\" Democratic Illinois Rep. Danny Davis defended Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan as an \u201coutstanding human being\u201d on Monday. Farrakhan\u2019s history of racially extreme comments includes blaming Jews for the September 11 attacks, saying white people \u201cdeserve to die\u201d and praising Adolf Hitler as a \u201cvery great man.\u201d \u201cI personally know [Farrakhan], I\u2019ve been to his home, done meetings, participated in events with him,\u201d Davis told TheDC. The congressman wasn\u2019t sure why the ADL wrote that he had been misquoted in his praise for the anti-Semite, and said he wasn\u2019t sure if someone from his office had told the ADL he was misquoted, he told The Daily Caller News Foundation on Sunday. \u201cI think that was what they wanted to write. Nah, I don\u2019t have no problems with Farrakhan, I don\u2019t spend a whole lot of my time dealing with those kind of things,\u201d Davis said. \u201cThat\u2019s just one segment of what goes on in our world. The world is so much bigger than Farrakhan and the Jewish question and his position on that and so forth. For those heavy into it, that\u2019s their thing, but it ain\u2019t my thing,\u201d he said The \"Jewish Question\" is a term generally used by anti-Semites today. But J Street is stuck with its own Jewish Question. How much anti-Semitism is too much even for it. Left-wing advocacy group J Street said it is re-evaluating its endorsement of a congressman who praised Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan. JStreetPAC, the arm of the NGO that funds and endorses candidates, currently lists Rep. Danny Davis, an Illinois Democrat from the virulently anti-Semitic Farrakhan\u2019s home base of Chicago, as a candidate it supports. The endorsement, first reported in the Forward, calls Davis \u201ca longtime supporter of Israel and a two-state solution.\u201d In J Street's home dimension of Oceania, supporter of Israel means Farrakhan supporter. \u201cWe take anti-Semitism quite seriously,\u201d J Street\u2019s statement read. \u201cWe are currently in conversation with Representative Davis\u2019 office about this issue. We will get back to you shortly with a more extensive response.\u201d So seriously that J Street can't decide what to do about a politician who defends a Hitler-lover and raises the Jewish Question. That's serious all right. Seriously Kapo.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

(Reuters photo: Giorgio Perottino) In a debate, Ross Douthat and Massimo Faggioli discussed Pope Francis\u2019s legacy and its effect on internal Church controversies. On Wednesday night, New York Times columnist Ross Douthat and Villanova professor of theology Massimo Faggioli came together for a debate entitled \u201cFrancis @ Five: Assessing the Legacy of Pope Francis Five Years after His Election.\u201d As I made my way up to Fordham University, I was excited. Having followed Douthat and Faggioli\u2019s ongoing dialogue on Twitter, I knew I was in for a lively, if predictable, conversation. In his opening remarks, Douthat laid out three criteria that can be used to evaluate Francis\u2019s papacy thus far: his impact on the public\u2019s perception of the Church (a success); his attempts at reforming the Vatican bureaucracy (a disappointment); and his position on \u201cmoral-theological controversies,\u201d specifically, communion for the divorced and remarried (a problem). Advertisement Advertisement Faggioli, meanwhile, outlined a genuinely surprising position. Rather than making a straightforward case for why Pope Francis has changed the Church for the better, Faggioli rejected the possibility of evaluating his papacy in terms of \u201ccontinuity\u201d with past popes, since doing so would assume that \u201cChristianity at some point . . . was complete,\u201d which Faggioli does not think is true. While I emphatically disagree with this argument, I have to hand it to Faggioli: From the outset, he made clear that he was not planning to debate Douthat on the implications of the Francis papacy. Instead, through a combination of rhetorical tricks and soft-peddled Hegelianism, he would completely redefine the role and nature of the Catholic Church. During the crux of the debate \u2014 the discussion of communion for the divorced and remarried \u2014 Faggioli raised his most theologically unsettling point. To defend his position that remarried persons should be able to receive communion, Faggioli invoked the case of Germany, where 50 percent of Catholic marriages end in divorce. For Faggioli, the implication is that at least 50 percent of German Catholic children never see their parents receive communion and lose their faith because of it. This, he says, is \u201cbad for evangelization,\u201d and in order to keep the pews full, the Church\u2019s role should not be to deny communion to the divorced and remarried, but instead to ask, \u201cWhat can the Catholic Church do to make the faithful able to receive sacraments?\u201d Advertisement This is a lovely suggestion, and one that I\u2019m not entirely unsympathetic to. However, the fact remains that Faggioli is suggesting the Church do much more than provide sacraments to the faithful. Just before invoking the German case, Faggioli characterized the country as one of the most secular in the world. But rather than lamenting what secularism has wrought on marital life in Germany, reasserting the Church\u2019s position on marriage, and insisting that the faithful strive to live according to her laws, Faggioli argues that the Church ought to bend to the will of secular society. Advertisement It should be clear to anyone, not just practicing Catholics, that this is absurd. If the Church exists simply to accommodate the whims and failures of secular modernity, then what is the point of the Church? Pope Benedict XVI has warned against precisely the kind of \u201caccommodation\u201d Faggioli is calling for, writing that when \u201cthe people cannot cope\u201d with God, they \u201cbring him down into their own world,\u201d and insist that \u201che must be the kind of God that [they need].\u201d In other words, \u201cMan is using God, and, in reality, even if it is not outwardly discernible, he is placing himself above God.\u201d To fully drive the point home, Benedict equates this kind of worship with the Israelites desert worship of the bull calf. Unsurprisingly, this progressive interpretation of Catholic doctrine eventually reveals itself to be rank historicism. Throughout the debate, Faggioli drew out the argument that allowing the remarried to receive communion would not represent a radical change in doctrine but a return to the teachings of the Gospel. Eventually, Douthat drew his argument to its logical conclusion with this question: Were priests throughout history in fact misleading their divorced and remarried parishioners by telling them they could not receive communion? After a few seconds\u2019 pause, Faggioli gave the only answer he could: \u201cThere are different responses to the same question in different times.\u201d Advertisement Throughout their conversation, both Douthat and Faggioli repeatedly observed that the debate over Pope Francis and the future of the Church is carried on primarily among Catholic intellectuals, unbeknownst to most of \u201cthe flock.\u201d Advertisement It strikes me, however, that everybody \u2014 Catholic or not \u2014 has a dog in this fight, which is about more than communion and canon law. At its core, this debate is about truth and our ability to judge right from wrong. Could we possibly say, for instance, that it\u2019s impossible to judge the presidency of Donald Trump relative to past presidents? Of course not \u2014 that would be preposterous, as I\u2019m sure Faggioli would agree. To pass moral judgements on papacies, presidencies, or anything else, we must have recourse to truth, and to the institutions that have upheld this truth for centuries. Whether in the Church or in the academy, we must resist this dangerous historicist impulse. If we don\u2019t, we will find ourselves, in the words of Pope Benedict, in \u201ca dictatorship of relativism that does not recognize anything as definitive and whose ultimate goal consists solely of one\u2019s own ego and desires.\u201d Advertisement READ MORE: A Defense of the Catholic Tradition The Left\u2019s New Plan to Gut Religious-Liberty Protections What\u2019s At Stake in the Fight For Religious Freedom\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

            "question": "Which of the following tactics is used in the following text?\n\nArticle: Kavanaugh and Last-Minute Accusations Democrats are pulling out all the stops and enabling salacious last-minute accusations against Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh in order to sink his candidacy. Now that Christine Blasey Ford has finally agreed to testify this Thursday at an open hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding her charge that Judge Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her at a long-ago high school party, these new charges have suddenly emerged from left field. On Sunday, a former classmate from Judge Kavanaugh's time at Yale accused the Supreme Court nominee of exposing himself to her at a party. The New Yorker has just published an article written by Ronan Farrow and Jane Mayer, based on information that was reportedly sent to at least four Democratic senators. The article recounted a claim by Deborah Ramirez, a Yale classmate of Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s, concerning \u201ca dormitory party gone awry.\u201d As the article acknowledged, however, \u201cher memories contained gaps because she had been drinking at the time of the alleged incident.\u201d The article goes on to say that in her initial conversations with The New Yorker, Ms. Ramirez was \u201creluctant to characterize Kavanaugh\u2019s role in the alleged incident with certainty.\u201d It was only after \u201csix days of carefully assessing her memories and consulting with her attorney\u201d that Ms. Ramirez was suddenly able to pinpoint Judge Kavanaugh as having committed an unsavory act, even though she admitted being \u201cfoggy\u201d at the time. The New Yorker article also noted that the magazine \u201chas not confirmed with other eyewitnesses that Kavanaugh was present at the party.\u201d Meanwhile, the ever-present Michael Avenatti, attorney of porn star Stormy Daniels, tweeted that he had information from anonymous sources that Judge Kavanaugh and his friend had \"targeted\" women with drugs and alcohol at parties to facilitate \"gang rape.\" Haters of Judge Kavanaugh are turning the process of Senate confirmation of a Supreme Court nominee into something worse than a travesty. His opponents in the Senate have transformed their \u201cadvise and consent\u201d function into a campaign of no-holds barred character assassination. While Judge Kavanaugh weathers these latest accusations, which he adamantly denies, his real test will be on Thursday, assuming that Christine Blasey Ford will follow through on her agreement to testify at an open hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Her attorneys stalled for a week before making the announcement that Ms. Ford would testify despite certain \u201cunresolved\u201d issues. Among the issues Ms. Ford\u2019s attorneys have raised was the refusal of the committee to subpoena one of the purported witnesses, Mark Judge, who Ms. Ford reportedly claims was involved in the alleged incident, as well as \u201cwho on the Majority side will be asking the questions, whether senators or staff attorneys.\" A week has already gone by since Ms. Ford went public with her story in an interview with the Washington Post while Ms. Ford and her attorneys stalled for time. They raised one procedural issue after another while claiming that the committee majority was \u201cbullying\u201d Ms. Ford. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley (R-I) has bent over backwards to accommodate Ms. Ford\u2019s preferred scheduling for her appearance. He extended the deadline several times for her to come to a decision on whether to testify at all. He had offered various options for her to testify publicly or privately or to be interviewed by committee staff in her home state of California, whichever setting would make her more comfortable. However, in Senator Grassley\u2019s e-mail thanking Ms. Ford for finally agreeing to a time certain for her testimony, Senator Grassley correctly reminded her attorneys that \u201cthe committee determines which witnesses to call, how many witnesses to call, and what order to call them and who will question them. These are nonnegotiable.\u201d While the negotiations with Ms. Ford\u2019s attorneys for her testimony were underway, Democrats were sitting on the latest allegations, ready to pounce as soon as Ms. Ford\u2019s accusation was about to be heard. Some Democrats are already using the Ramirez episode to push anew for a fresh FBI investigation and to postpone Thursday\u2019s scheduled hearing. Ideally, if the Democrats cannot apply enough pressure to force a withdrawal of Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination through their relentless campaign of character assassination, they want to push any Senate votes until after the midterm elections at the earliest. Then they will claim that the newly elected senators should be involved in the confirmation decision. In the meantime, Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s adversaries in the Senate, the mainstream media and progressive circles continue to bludgeon Judge Kavanaugh in the court of public opinion. All of their stratagems are an obvious attempt to buy time in order to persuade any wavering senators that Judge Kavanaugh is too tainted by sexual assault charges \u2013 whether proven or not - to sit on the Supreme Court. Proof does not matter to those wanting to bring Judge Kavanaugh down at any cost. Regarding Ms. Ford\u2019s accusation, they know that the proof so far is non-existent, aside from Ms. Ford\u2019s own assertions contained in her confidential letter given to Senator Dianne Feinstein, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, last July, and in her Washington Post interview. While a redacted version of Ms. Ford\u2019s letter has been published, Senator Feinstein has refused to date to give even Senator Grassley a copy of the completely unredacted version. The FBI has already conducted 6 background checks, no federal crime is alleged, and there is no forensic evidence to investigate after 30 years at a site that Ms. Ford cannot even identify. What we do know so far tends to undercut the credibility of Ms. Ford\u2019s accusation. Ms. Ford cannot corroborate her decades-old charge of sexual assault against Judge Kavanaugh. Whatever corroboration Ms. Ford was hoping for from \u201cwitnesses\u201d she claimed were at the alleged party is non-existent. The individuals she reportedly named in her unredacted confidential letter given to Senator Feinstein have either denied being at such a party or do not recollect what Ms.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

Guyger claims that she accidentally entered the wrong apartment and shot a man who she thought was a burglar, however, eyewitness testimony has contradicted her initial statement. Despite admitting to killing an innocent man and having her initial statement contradicted by witness testimony, Guyger has been treated as more of a victim than a killer. In fact, Guyger\u2019s apartment was never even searched for evidence, and she was allowed to \u201cvacate\u201d the premises without any type of search. By not searching her apartment immediately, police ruined the investigation, making it harder to prosecute her.

Meanwhile, Botham Jean, the actual victim, had his house searched immediately. Police claim to have found a very small amount of marijuana, which they attempted to use to smear his name and somehow justify the killing. It is obvious in this case that Guyger is receiving special treatment, not only did she get away without a search, but she turned herself in at her own convenience and was let out two hours later. Not even the richest people in the country with the best lawyers would receive this type of treatment if they just admitted to killing an innocent person. There has also been controversy over the fact that Guyger has been charged with manslaughter instead of murder, which will make it possible for her to receive a much short prison sentence. As Guyger walks free awaiting her trial, the 9 people who were arrested protesting the murder and Guyger\u2019s special treatment are still sitting behind bars. After a ceremony for Botham Jean, the protesters were arrested for obstructing traffic. Attorney Lee Merritt, who represents Botham Jean\u2019s family, posted an update about the injustice on Twitter.

The officer who shot and killed Botham Jean remains on the Dallas police force and was able to bond out on manslaughter charges in a fraction of the time the protestors have spent in jail,\u201d Merritt said in a statement. Merrit cast suspicion on the police for intentionally keeping these protestors in jail to send a message and make an example out of them. The reaction from the police, in this case, has shown that they believe they have a license to kill and that they cannot be trusted to monitor themselves and keep one another in check.

The report shows how State Department and Treasury Deparment officials during the Obama era quietly gave a special license for a major Omani bank to do business with two U.S. banks. Barack Obama spent considerable time selling the American people on the idea of a cooperative Iran \u2014 all the while cutting quiet deals, behind closed doors, with the rogue nation. take our poll - story continues below Completing this poll grants you access to Freedom Outpost updates free of charge.

Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician? The U.S. banks were pressured into complying with the deal. The Washington Times has more: The Obama administration \u2014 despite repeatedly assuring Congress that Iran would remain barred from the U.S. financial system \u2014 secretly mobilized to give Tehran access to American banks to convert the windfall of cash it received from sanctions relief under the 2015 nuclear deal into dollars, an investigative report by the Senate has revealed. A copy of the report, obtained by The Washington Times, outlines how Obama-era State and Treasury Department officials discreetly issued a special license for the conversion to a major Omani bank and unsuccessfully pressured two U.S. banks to partake in the transaction, all while misleading lawmakers about the activities. The document, compiled by the Senate\u2019s Republican-led chief investigative subcommittee, began circulating Tuesday, just as the Trump administration issued its harshest warnings to date to foreign governments and companies to avoid doing business with Iran or find themselves in the crosshairs of Washington\u2019s reimposition of sanctions as part of Mr. Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the nuclear deal. \u201cCompanies doing business in Iran face substantial risks, and those risks are even greater as we reimpose nuclear-related sanctions,\u201d said Sigal Mandelker, Treasury Department undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence. She also called on foreign governments to harden their financial systems against \u201cdeceptive\u201d Iranian transactions that ultimately channel money to terrorists. The Iranian government \u201cuses shell and front companies to conceal its tracks\u201d as part of an elaborate scheme designed to procure cash for the Quds Force of Iran\u2019s militant Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which the U.S. designates as a terrorist organization, Ms. Mandelker said. She issued the warnings in a speech at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies think tank as Iran announced Tuesday that it was formally moving ahead with preparations to increase its nuclear enrichment capacities \u2014 the sharpest response to date by the Islamic republic to Mr. Trump\u2019s pullout from the nuclear accord. Iranian officials said the increase, while provocative, does not violate its commitments under the nuclear accord. The president sent shock waves around the world with his May 8 decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear pact and begin reimposing U.S. sanctions, which the U.S., Europe, China and Russia had collectively lifted in 2015 in exchange for Iran\u2019s promise to curb its suspect nuclear programs and allow international inspections. While Iran told the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency on Tuesday that it plans only to increase enrichment within limits set by 2015 deal, the announcement came with threats from a top Iranian official that the activities could be quickly expanded. The warning put fresh pressure on European leaders to keep the nuclear accord alive despite Mr. Trump\u2019s withdrawal. The head of Iran\u2019s nuclear agency, Ali Akbar Salehi, said Tehran is prepared to dramatically increase its capacity for enrichment but that the work so far is limited to building a facility for assembling the centrifuges. He made the comment a day after Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, ordered the increase in capacity and vowed that Iran would preserve its nuclear program despite the U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 accord. The Senate report focuses new scrutiny on the lengths President Obama\u2019s team was willing to go to ensure the deal\u2019s success as it was still being negotiated. The Senate Homeland Security Committee\u2019s permanent subcommittee on investigations probe contends that the Obama administration went out of its way to keep U.S. lawmakers in the dark about calculated and secretive efforts to give Tehran a back channel to the international financial system and to U.S. banks, facilitating a massive U.S. currency conversion worth billions of dollars. \u201cSenior U.S. government officials repeatedly testified to Congress that Iranian access to the U.S. financial system was not on the table or part of any deal,\u201d according to a draft copy of the document obtained by The Times. \u201cDespite these claims, the U.S. Department of the Treasury, at the direction of the U.S. State Department, granted a specific license that authorized a conversion of Iranian assets worth billions of U.S. dollars using the U.S. financial system. \u201cEven after the specific license was issued, U.S. government officials maintained in congressional testimony that Iran would not be granted access to the U.S. financial system,\u201d the report said. Sen. Rob Portman, the Ohio Republican who chairs the subcommittee, is set to outline his panel\u2019s findings Wednesday. Under terms of the nuclear deal, Iran was given the right to reclaim billions of dollars in state assets and bank accounts frozen by international sanctions, but it remained \u201cillegal for U.S. persons, entities, and financial institutions to do business with Iran or parties on behalf of Iran.\u201d The ban included any \u201cintermediary\u201d transactions by U.S. banks to convert currency for Iran \u2014 a development that would have elevated the value of the Iranian assets on the global market and allowed Tehran to more easily move the money through the\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

Keith Ellison CONFRONTED About Domestic Violence Allegations Produced by Sean CampbellAs he arrived for a campaign event in Minnesota on Saturday, Rep. Keith Ellison (D-MN) was confronted by investigative journalist Laura Loomer about the numerous domestic violence allegations that have been brought against him by two different women.Loomer questioned Ellison about a 2005 police report filed by Amy Alexander, a Democrat activist who he had a relationship with. With the police report in hand, Loomer asked Ellison to explain why the police report says there was a domestic violence call to Alexander's house, despite the fact that Ellison has denied the allegations.Please Support my Independent Journalism: http://bit.ly/loomeredTHANK YOU IN ADVANCE FOR YOUR CONTRIBUTION! Posted by Laura Loomer on Monday, September 3, 2018 His supporters continuously tried to block Loomer, even trying to put their hands on her, cover up her camera and getting in her way of asking honest answers that Ellison owes the people whom he is asking to vote for him. Loomer asked why the police were called to Amy Alexander's house in 2005 over domestic violence. Ellison was in a relationship with Alexander at that time, but has denied the allegations. He fails, however, to relay his side of the story. However, 911 call documents show that Alexander named Ellison as her assaulter. #MnAg \u2014\u2014> RT @jpkolb: UPDATE: This is a record of a 911 call from May 16, 2005.

Even one woman in the Loomer video says, why are they waiting till now to bring this forward? Well, for Ms. Monahan, perhaps that could be asked, but not for Amy Alexander. That report was filed more than a decade ago. It appears that with Ms. Monahan's claims and Keith Ellison's unwillingness to address the public with his side of the story that perhaps, he has not changed his ways at all. In fact, he can more than likely justify his actions based upon the demonic teachings of Muhammad in the Koran. He has already won the primary to be Minnesota's AG.

The pictures were published by numerous news outlets and shared by millions of people on social media. At the time the photos were published by the Daily Mail, police had not mentioned if Paddock left behind a note in his hotel room. Nevada Sheriff Joe Lombardo said police were investigating who leaked the crime scene photos. In one photo in particular, a white piece of paper or notepad on a side table next to a chair is visible, which caused some to speculate that it may have been a suicide note. Soon after the photos were leaked, Twitter was abuzz with chatter referencing the paper, with people spreading cover-up conspiracies and rumors that it was a suicide note.

In their first in-depth interview, which will air on CBS Sunday evening, the officers who stormed Stephen Paddock\u2019s hotel room revealed new details to 60 Minutes that finally explain what was written on the mysterious note. \u201cI could see on it he had written the distance, the elevation he was on, the drop of what his bullet was gonna be for the crowd,\u201d said Officer Dave Newton from the Las Vegas Police in a preview clip of Sunday\u2019s report. \u201cSo he had that written down and figured out so he would know where to shoot to hit his targets from there.\u201d Paddock\u2019s note was clearly not a suicide letter. Rather, it detailed bullet trajectory and included calculations about where he needed to aim his weapons to maximize accuracy and optimize his kill rate. Investigators have also been looking for a \u2018mystery woman\u2019 who was seen with Stephen Paddock in the days leading up to the Las Vegas shooting. According to ABC News, the \u2018mystery woman\u2019 everyone on the internet was talking about has been identified. While officials did not reveal the woman\u2019s name, they did tell reporters she was a prostitute. Police are still investigating whether or not Paddock acted alone.

            "question": "Which of the following tactics is used in the following text?\n\nArticle: Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II Still, we\u2019re also averse to speaking in terms of good and evil. Right and wrong? Maybe. But good and evil have a supernatural ring we usually reserve for dramatic and abominable crimes, like genocide. Yet everything right is good, and everything wrong is evil. The evils we encounter in our day-to-day lives might not be a spectacle, like jihadists beheading a journalist on live television. All the same, evil is part of ordinary life. It dwells deep in our hearts \u2013 each and every one of us. The Prince of this World has made a grand display of his authority in the last few centuries. Our saving grace is that, while Westerners no longer believe in God, they still believe in the Devil. We\u2019re at least clear-eyed enough to recognize true evil at work in the world, even if we can no longer see the great Good hidden behind the veil. This is the point about the McCarrick scandal that even religious commentators tend to overlook. How was he allowed to go on molesting young priests and seminarians when virtually the entire Church hierarchy knew what he was up to? And how was such a depraved individual ordained in the first place, let alone promoted to Cardinal-Archbishop of Washington? The answer is, ultimately, demonic. As Catholics, we ask St. Michael to \u201ccast into Hell Satan and all the evil spirits who prowl about the world seeking the ruin of souls.\u201d McCarrick and his fellow perverts in the clergy are responsible, not only for their sexual abuses, but also for chasing good men away from the priesthood. Spend enough time in Catholic World and you inevitably meet good men who quit the seminary because of some rampant (and often violent) depravity. What could suit the Devil more than to watch the Church burn her wheat as she gathers the chaff? The gates of Hell will not prevail against the Church, as Our Lord promised. But they won\u2019t stop trying, either. They\u2019ve attacked from the front, sending the Roman pagans, French Revolutionaries, and British American secularists. They flank us by sending heretics like Arius, Luther, and Hans Kung. Today, there\u2019s also a fifth column working to tear down the walls from within \u2013 not only pedophiles like John Geoghan, but also predators like Theodore McCarrick. Where did those fifth columnists enter? Why, there\u2019s only one possible explanation: the Second Vatican Council. Aggiornamento sounds like a Lefebvrist slur. The idea that an ecumenical council of the Catholic Church would openly seek to \u201cbring itself up to date\u201d is ridiculous. Yet that was precisely the aim. As St Pope John XXIII explained, \u201cIts principal task will be concerned with the conditions and modernization of the Church after 20 centuries of life.\u201d It was not supposed (as some have claimed) to simply update the liturgy from its last redesign in 1570. The goal was to align the Church more with modern world: a world defined, to a considerable extent, by its rejection of the Catholic world that flourished before the Protestant Reformation and French Revolution. Now, I don\u2019t believe Pope John saw himself as endangering either orthodoxy or sacred, immutable tradition. I share Pope Paul IV\u2019s view. When he heard that the Council was being convened, then-Cardinal Montini is supposed to have sighed, \u201cThis holy old boy doesn\u2019t realise what a hornet\u2019s nest he\u2019s stirring up.\u201d Nonetheless, he stirred it. The spirit of aggiornamento quickly spread through the Church in the 1960s \u2013 and the seminaries especially. Seminarians called for a more \u201cparticipatory\u201d administration. They became involved in socialist politics. They formed trade unions to demand the right to marry. They practiced sauvage intercommunion. Of course, they had their enablers in the hierarchy as well. Perhaps the worst was Archbishop Marty of Paris, a leader of the \u201cpriest-worker movement\u201d who defended Marxist and existentialist atheisms on the floor of the Council. During a homily at the Cathedral, he also praised the soixantehuitards: \u201cthe great outburst of the younger generation that suddenly wanted to take its place in life\u201d that occurred in his city in May of 1968. \u201cOne also felt that, in these events of May,\u201d Marty continued, \u201cthe seriousness of the working class, which wants not only to earn a living wage, but also to find its freedom, its independence.\u201d Theaggiornamentistas was never purged from the Church, and certainly not from the seminaries. As the modern world continued to reject traditional Christian mores, so too does the Church seem increasingly \u201cout of step\u201d and in need of \u201cmodernizing\u201d. Inevitably, this came to mean the acceptance of homosexuality. Bishop Wilton D. Gregory, as president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, infamously spoke of \u201can ongoing struggle to make sure that the Catholic priesthood is not dominated by homosexual men.\u201d But that predominance has very little to do with homosexuality per se. Rather, the 1960s rejection of celibacy in the seminaries naturally provided more (shall we say) opportunities for gay men \u2013 given that there are, of course, no women in Catholic seminaries. This began driving away heterosexuals, as well as homosexuals who upheld the Church\u2019s teachings on chastity and celibacy. Needless to say, not all gay priests are violent predators like McCarrick. But the toleration of sexually active priests gave McCarrick cover to \u201cseduce\u201d his victims. Many have also speculated that, because McCarrick\u2019s victims were overwhelmingly above the age of consent, the media didn\u2019t consider them newsworthy. If he\u2019d fondled a 12-year old altar boy, that would have been one thing. Pedophile priests sell papers. But taking an 18-year-old seminarian to bed? Running that story would simply be outing a closeted gay man: an act the liberal press would no doubt consider \u201chomophobic\u201d, as Ross Douthat pointed out. Meanwhile, those bishops who didn\u2019t approve of his actions knew the culture \u2013 both within the Church and without her \u2013 were against them.

The release is the culmination of an 18-month probe, led by state Attorney General Josh Shapiro, on six of the state\u2019s eight dioceses \u2014 Harrisburg, Pittsburgh, Allentown, Scranton, Erie and Greensburg \u2014 and follows other state grand jury reports that revealed abuse and coverups in two other dioceses. Some details and names that might reveal the 300 clergy listed have been redacted from the report. Legal challenges by clergy delayed the report\u2019s release, after some said it is a violation of their constitutional rights. Pennsylvania\u2019s Supreme Court ruled last month that the report must be released but with some redaction. The report\u2019s release begins an information war, with prosecutors and many victims saying it\u2019s the start of holding church leaders at the top accountable for the first time, while church lawyers and other advocates for the institution say the report depicts an era of another century, unfairly smearing today\u2019s Catholicism in Pennsylvania. The report has helped renew a crisis many in the church thought and hoped had ended nearly 20 years ago after the scandal erupted in Boston. But recent abuse-related scandals, from Chile to Australia, have reopened wounding questions about accountability and whether church officials are still covering up crimes at the highest levels. The new wave of allegations has called Pope Francis\u2019s handling of abuse into question as many Catholics look to him to help the church regain its credibility. The pope\u2019s track record has been mixed, something some outsiders attribute to his learning curve or shortcomings and others chalk up to resistance from a notoriously change-averse institution. The Pennsylvania grand jury report follows the resignation last month of Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, a towering figure in the U.S. church and former D.C. archbishop who was accused of sexually abusing minors and adults for decades. Both have further polarized the church on homosexuality, celibacy and whether laypeople should have more power. It has also triggered debate about whether statutes of limitations should be expanded. \u201cWe\u2019re dealing with a long-term struggle not only about the meaning of justice, but about the meaning of memory,\u201d said Jason Berry, a reporter and author who has covered the sexual abuse crisis for decades. \u201cAnd how honest the church has been about this crisis. Most bishops, besides apologies, have not been on the cutting edge of change.\u201d Church officials began bracing for the aftermath of the report. On Monday, D.C.\u2019s archbishop, Cardinal Donald Wuerl, former longtime leader of the Pittsburgh diocese, warned his priests in a letter that the probe will be \u201cprofoundly disturbing.\u201d REMNANT COMMENT: The report also shows that \u201cmore than 90 \u2018offenders\u2019 will be listed\u201d in Donald Cardinal Wuerl\u2019s former diocese, which is ironic since Wuerl is one of Pope Francis\u2019s closest U.S. advisers and sits on the Vatican\u2019s bishop oversight committee. Well played, Cardinal Wuerl! So, let me get this straight (I know, lots of luck with that one): These are the people that are going to \"accompany us\" and our children in the \"synodal Church\" with its new orientation, overseen by a \"God of Surprises\" who is uber-merciful and doesn't judge, and headed up by a pope who, according to Father Thomas Rosica, \"breaks Catholic traditions whenever he wants, because he is 'free from disordered attachments'?'' You don't say! All this and rampant homosexuality in the priesthood, too... along with a \"trivialized liturgy\" (according to Pope Benedict XVI) and widespread apostasy among the faithful? Remind me again: What exactly has Vatican II and the last fifty years of aggiornamento given us? Because I can't seem to think of a darn thing, apart from heretical homilies, sodomitical clergy and an increasingly lavender liturgy. You know what, guys? Thanks, but no thanks. You can take your 'Church of Accompaniment\" to prison with you. I'd sooner let my kids be accompanied by fans of the Oakland Raiders than turn them over to you... meaning no disrespect to fans of the Oakland Raiders, of course. #stopthesynod\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

            "question": "Which of the following tactics is used in the following text?\n\nArticle: Foolish Religion Author Gary Wills: \u2018The Religion of the Qur\u2019an Is a Religion of Peace\u2019 Outside of specialists and seekers, the only reason why there is general interest in the Qur\u2019an among non-Muslims is to seek an answer to the question of whether or not it justifies and encourages Islamic terrorism. With What the Qur\u2019an Meant: And Why It Matters, religion author Garry Wills is here to reassure us: What did the scripture of Islam tell me about the duty to kill infidels? Some people are sure it is there, though it isn\u2019t. Then what does it say about Shari\u2019ah law? Not a thing (p. 7). That would be good to know, were Wills a reliable witness. Unfortunately, he proves to be just the opposite: Wills laments \u201cRobert Spencer of Jihad Watch calling for a ban on the Qur\u2019an\u201d (p. 58). I have never called for such a ban, and oppose in principle the banning of any book. Wills, not surprisingly, does not offer any quotation from me to back up his false claim. His manifest unreliability on this point casts a shadow on his primary assertions about the Qur\u2019an. Wills seems determined to put the best possible face on the Qur\u2019an, which requires him to ignore a great deal of Qur\u2019anic incitement and hatred. For example, he quotes 5:51 -- \u201cYou who believe, do not take the Jews and Christians as allies\u201d (p. 114) -- but he nonetheless concludes, after ten pages of tu quoque arguments and other legerdemain, that \u201cthe Qur\u2019an is fraternal in its treatment of other faiths\u201d (p. 124). Wills never mentions Qur\u2019an 9:29, which commands Muslims to wage war against Jews and Christians and subjugate them as inferiors under the rule of Sharia. Wills is no more trustworthy when he deals with the question of violence in the Qur\u2019an. He renders one key passage in this way: \u201cFight then until there is no more persecution, and worship [at the shrine] is devoted to God\u201d (2:193; p. 133). Whence the bracketed interpolation \u201cat the shrine\u201d? Wills doesn\u2019t give any source for it; apparently it comes from none other than Garry Wills himself. By adding \u201cat the shrine\u201d to this verse, Wills restricts the call to fight to the area around the Sacred Mosque in Mecca. He ignores the fact that some Islamic authorities see this passage as calling for nothing less than unlimited warfare against non-Muslims. The prominent Twentieth Century Indian Islamic scholar Muhammad Ashiq Ilahi Bulandshahri explains the passage this way: The worst of sins are Infidelity ( Kufr) and Polytheism ( shirk) which constitute rebellion against Allah, The Creator. To eradicate these, Muslims are required to wage war until there exists none of it in the world, and the only religion is that of Allah. Wills doesn\u2019t mention the existence of such interpretations, even to dismiss them. Likewise, when he claims that the Qur\u2019an has \u201cnot a thing\u201d to say about Sharia, he appears unaware that the Qur\u2019an is one of the sources of Sharia. The Qur\u2019an\u2019s declarations that a woman\u2019s testimony is worth half that of a man\u2019s (2:282), that a daughter is to receive a smaller part of an inheritance than a son receives (4:11), that thieves are to have their hands amputated (5:38), and that those who \u201cwage war against Allah and his messenger\u201d are to be crucified or have a hand and foot amputated on opposite sides (5:33) are part of Sharia in all its various expressions. Because these stipulations are found in the Qur\u2019an, they cannot be questioned or set aside. Throughout his book, Wills\u2019 assurances that the Qur\u2019an is not really as bad as \u201cright-wing Islamophobes\u201d say, or that the Bible contains material that is just as bad or worse, dissolve under close scrutiny. Again and again it turns out that Wills has ignored key passages in order to make his case. He asks why the Qur\u2019an is \u201cso ferocious to \u2018hypocrites\u2019 and apostates\u201d (p. 124). Then he offers a quotation from the New Testament Letter to the Hebrews saying that \u201cif we sin again on purpose\u201d there is \u201conly a terrifying judgment to come\u201d (p. 126). Wills concludes: \u201cThe Qur\u2019an is not as absolute as this, because it always leaves room for God\u2019s inexhaustible mercy and forgiveness\u201d (p. 126). That sounds wonderful, and certainly pleasing to multicultural ears to learn that the Qur\u2019an is more merciful than the New Testament. Until one realizes that, in his discussion of apostasy in the Qur\u2019an, Wills has omitted all mention of the primary Qur\u2019anic passage on this topic: take our poll - story continues below Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?

Many thanks to our friends at LifeSiteNews, especially Diane Montagna, for the following translation and release of the follow-up testimony from arguably the most courageous prelate in the Church today\u2014Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigan\u00f2. The former Apostolic Nuncio to the United States has, as they say, doubled down. Far from backing-away and making excuses for his early actions, as we\u2019ve all become so accustomed to seeing in these rare cases where a hierarch breaks ranks, Archbishop Vigan\u00f2 is digging in with a 4-page bombshell that restates his initial accusations of abuse cover-up against Francis and other powerful members of the hierarchy, and even concludes with a suggestion that Francis is beginning to act as a \u201csubstitute of our Lord.\u201d Read the Archbishop\u2019s words for yourselves and note well the ring of truth that resonates in every sentence. This is clearly the testimony of an honest man who has only the good of the Church in his heart\u2014a modern-day Athanasius standing against something so much worse than Liberius. Friends, let us pray for Archbishop Vigan\u00f2. He is standing alone now, and not only against the most dangerous pontificate in history, but also the forces of hell itself\u2014forces which will do all in their power to silence this voice crying in the wilderness. Make no mistake about this: Archbishop Vigan\u00f2 is fighting for the very survival of the human element of the Catholic Church. He is standing against corrupt men in high places who cannot be trusted to do what is best for souls, for the Catholic faithful or indeed for Holy Mother Church herself. The enemy is not only at the gates but has now made their way to the thrones of power and the seats of the Apostles. God help us. It goes without saying that we here at The Remnant not only stand with Vigan\u00f2 but we thank God for him every day, we pray the Rosary for him every day, and wish him every blessing and heavenly consolation as he undergoes this passion for the sake of the Master he serves so well. God bless you, Your Excellency, and Mary keep you. We are with you! MJM _________________________________ Tit. Archbishop of Ulpiana Apostolic Nuncio Scio Cui credidi (2 Tim 1:12) Before starting my writing, I would first of all like to give thanks and glory to God the Father for every situation and trial that He has prepared and will prepare for me during my life. As a priest and bishop of the holy Church, spouse of Christ, I am called like every baptized person to bear witness to the truth. By the gift of the Spirit who sustains me with joy on the path that I am called to travel, I intend to do so until the end of my days. Our only Lord has addressed also to me the invitation, \u201cFollow me!\u201d, and I intend to follow him with the help of his grace until the end of my days. \u201cAs long as I have life, I will sing to the Lord, I will sing praise to my God while I have being. May my song be pleasing to him; For I rejoice in the Lord.\u201d (Psalm 103:33-34) ***** It has been a month since I offered my testimony, solely for the good of the Church, regarding what occurred at the audience with Pope Francis on June 23, 2013 and regarding certain matters I was given to know in the assignments entrusted to me at the Secretariat of State and in Washington, in relation to those who bear responsibility for covering up the crimes committed by the former archbishop of that capital. My decision to reveal those grave facts was for me the most painful and serious decision that I have ever made in my life. I made it after long reflection and prayer, during months of profound suffering and anguish, during a crescendo of continual news of terrible events, with thousands of innocent victims destroyed and the vocations and lives of young priests and religious disturbed. The silence of the pastors who could have provided a remedy and prevented new victims became increasingly indefensible, a devastating crime for the Church. Well aware of the enormous consequences that my testimony could have, because what I was about to reveal involved the successor of Peter himself, I nonetheless chose to speak in order to protect the Church, and I declare with a clear conscience before God that my testimony is true. Christ died for the Church, and Peter, Servus servorum Dei, is the first one called to serve the spouse of Christ. Certainly, some of the facts that I was to reveal were covered by the pontifical secret that I had promised to observe and that I had faithfully observed from the beginning of my service to the Holy See. But the purpose of any secret, including the pontifical secret, is to protect the Church from her enemies, not to cover up and become complicit in crimes committed by some of her members. I was a witness, not by my choice, of shocking facts and, as the Catechism of the Catholic Church states (par. 2491), the seal of secrecy is not binding when very grave harm can be avoided only by divulging the truth. Only the seal of confession could have justified my silence. Neither the pope, nor any of the cardinals in Rome have denied the facts I asserted in my testimony. \u201cQui tacet consentit\u201d surely applies here, for if they deny my testimony, they have only to say so, and provide documentation to support that denial. How can one avoid concluding that the reason they do not provide the documentation is that they know it confirms my testimony?

Ron DeSantis (R-FL) accuses the Republican House leadership of dragging their heels in the Spygate investigation. This has been evident for months now, as there are many connections and obvious questions that haven\u2019t been investigated. The FBI files contain memos that need to be scoured too. The House leaders are Paul Ryan (Speaker of the House), Kevin McCarthy (Majority Leader), Steve Scalise (Majority Whip) and Cathy McMorris Rodgers (House Republican Conference Chair). There is a decided lack of aggressiveness of this investigation. One source is Paul Ryan: Evidence: \u201cHouse Speaker Paul Ryan said Wednesday that Oversight Chairman Trey Gowdy was \u2018accurate\u2019 when he argued the FBI has acted appropriately in its ongoing probe of potential Russian links to the Trump campaign.\u201d How could Ryan possibly know this? Isn\u2019t he prejudging the case without even finding out what actually happened? If Ryan is correct, an investigation will show it; but the current evidence suggests he is wrong. By short-circuiting the investigation, Ryan is betraying the interest of the American people to learn what the FBI and CIA actually did against Trump. Another Republican who wants to stop investigating is former RNC Chair, Michael Steele: \u201cThere is no Spygate because there are no spies in the campaign.\u201d The attitude of Steve Scalise is wishy-washy. He\u2019s open to a special prosecutor, but his responses come across as passive, lacking push, zeal and enthusiasm to delve deeply into Spygate. There is a kind of coverup at work here in which important Republicans do not want to bolster Trump by adding substance to Spygate, and they do not want to clean up the FBI by aggressively investigating Spygate further. They don\u2019t want the rotten inner workings of the organization to be aired publicly. They want to preserve the FBI\u2019s reputation. They don\u2019t care to see Trump vindicated.

In a predictable performance, the duo cited mistakes and raised concerns but solved none of the lingering mysteries the massive report released last week that found anti-Trump bias did not affect FBI and DOJ decisions. On Tuesday Horowitz performed solo before a joint session of the House Oversight and Judiciary Committees. Oversight chairman Trey Gowdy delivered the opening statement. The attorney general had been accused of \u201csoftening or watering down his report,\u201d Gowdy said, \u201cWhen the reality is it was Jim Comey who softened and watered down his press release, announcing no charges against Secretary Clinton. We see Jim Comey and Jim Comey alone deciding which DOJ policies to follow and which to ignore, to decide whether there is sufficient evidence to support each and every element of an offense and we see Jim Comey and Jim Comey alone deciding whether to send a letter to Congress in the throes of looming election.\u201d In a devastating exchange with Horowitz, Gowdy said that \u201cprejudging the outcome of an investigation before it ends, and prejudging the outcome of an investigation before it begins\u201d is the \u201ctextbook definition of bias.\u201d Democrats echoed the IG report\u2019s conclusion that there was no bias. Republicans sought to tie up some loose threads. The IG report confirmed that President Obama communicated with Hillary Clinton on her unsecured email system. Horowitz said the president had been one of 13 who had done so. Rep. Steve King asked about the volume of communications between the president and Clinton. \u201cI\u2019ll have to get back to you on that,\u201d Horowitz said, and the IG was \u201cnot sure\u201d if any of the communications had involved classified or top secret material. If the IG did know the subject of the president\u2019s communications with Clinton, he failed to reveal any details. Horowitz \u201cwould have to ask\u201d if his team interviewed any officials at the Obama White House but said \u201cnot the president himself.\u201d Rep. King asked Horowitz about his first encounter with the switch of \u201cextremely careless\u201d for \u2018gross negligence,\u201d which violated a criminal statute. Horowitz found that Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, and James Comey were all involved. The IG also said his team focused on the fact that the classified material on Clinton\u2019s server was \u201cnot clearly marked,\u201d which repeated one of Clinton\u2019s claims about her negligence. As for the question of her \u201cintent,\u201d Horowitz said it arose \u201cmonths earlier,\u201d maybe in 2015, though he couldn\u2019t be sure. King said President Obama had suggested the \u201ccareless but not intentional\u201d language in a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d appearance in October of 2015. And King had observed that in his July 5, 2016 statement, James Comey used \u201cintent\u201d six times. Horowitz said Comey \u201cconcealed from the attorney general and the deputy attorney general, his intention to make a unilateral announcement in July 2016 about the reasons for his recommendations not to prosecute former Secretary Clinton.\u201d The IG also described his report as a \u201cthorough, comprehensive and objective recitation of the facts.\u201d The IG did confirm that Peter Strzok and Lisa Page worked on the Clinton investigation, the Russia and the Mueller team. Horowitz said Strzok and Page had exchanged \u201ctens of thousands of texts.\u201d Ohio Rep. James Jordan asked Horowitz when his team had discovered the message about \u201cwe\u2019ll stop\u201d Trump. Horowitz conceded that this meant \u201cstop Trump from becoming president.\u201d The IG said they uncovered that text in May, and Jordan asked \u201cwhy did we not see it until last Thursday?\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t answer that,\u201d Horowitz said, adding that it had been sent to Rod Rosenstein\u2019s department at the DOJ. Jordan concluded that Rosenstein \u201cmade the decision that we had to wait a month.\u201d Several representatives were curious about two FBI agents and one lawyer the IG report had not named. \u201cThe FBI raised a concern because they work on counterintelligence matters,\u201d Horowitz said. Rep Mark Meadows asked if the two FBI agents were Kevin Clinesmith and Sally Moyer, which the IG declined to confirm. \u201cThey don\u2019t work in counterintelligence,\u201d said Meadows, who charged that the FBI gave the IG \u201cfalse information\u201d and altered key witness reports. \u201cHow did Comey see the report before it came out?\u201d Rep. Darrell Issa wanted to know. Horowitz said Comey didn\u2019t see the whole thing, but explained that he allowed those the IG team had criticized to have a look before release. By the end of the day it was evident that Congress would have to hear from Comey, Rosenstein, Strzok and others. Horowitz confirmed that the IG is investigating whether FBI official Peter Strzok\u2019s anti-Trump bias factored into the launch of the bureau\u2019s Russia probe. Also on Tuesday Peter Strzok was \u201cescorted\u201d from the FBI building. As his lawyer told reporters, Strzok had \u201cplayed by the rules,\u201d but been targeted by \u201cunfounded personal attacks, political games and inappropriate information leaks.\u201d \u201cI hope he comes and portrays himself as a victim,\u201d Trey Gowdy told Fox News. Rep. Bob Goodlatte said the committee would issue a subpoena for Strzok to testify \u201cnext week.\u201d That will make for an exciting show on C-SPAN but none of this would be happening if the deep state plot to \u201cstop\u201d Trump had succeeded.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

The audio, released on the SoundCloud account of a local news reporter, is an almost three hour recording of transmissions between dispatch and units on the ground amid the confusion of the mass shooting that at one point details a report that a wife of a firefighter was actually pinned down in the Foundation Room bar on top of the Mandalay Hotel. Intellihub\u2019s Shepard Ambellas, who has extensively reported on the entire Vegas cover-up since the beginning, recently found that at around the 1:27:54 mark of the audio file you can clearly hear dispatch describing the situation to first responders who are headed in that direction. \u201cWe have a firefighter\u2019s wife at this event who is pinned down behind the bar at Mandalay Bay. We are trying to get further on the name,\u201d dispatch frantically notes. \u201cBatallion 6, be advised that we are getting reports on Mandalay Bay, at the bar, we currently have, another active shooter up there.\u201d After being asked to confirm the information, dispatch goes on to make clear that she is specifically speaking about the bar at the top of the hotel rather than anywhere near the 32nd floor room that Stephen Paddock supposedly operated from. \u201cThe only information I have is it\u2019s the bar on top of the Mandalay Bay,\u201d dispatch continues before being asked if the shooter was pinned down or \u201cjust sheltering right now?\u201d Interestingly, the story doesn\u2019t end there, as Ambellas wrote in his piece, author and entrepreneur Grant Cardone was actually holding an investors meeting in the very same bar shortly before the attack took place. The popular social media influencer apparently left the Foundation Room literally seven minutes before authorities claim Paddock opened fire from his 32nd floor room. Cardone wrote about his experience in a post on Medium in which he claimed that the Mandalay Bay was telling visitors that there was at least one active shooter, \u201cmoving\u201d throughout the hotel shooting people. It was reported by the Mandalay there was a shooter moving through the hotel. I told Elena and Johnny, \u201cstay close to me, we are not running out, stay calm, there is one person in charge \u2014 where I go, you follow, no matter what.\u201d [\u2026] About this time, there was starting to be a lot more activity through the casino and now the reports suggested there was active multiple terrorists moving through the hotel shooting guest. Then twitter started showing up with feeds suggesting multiple hotels being attacked, bomb threats, and more. This new report documenting yet another instance of a possible second shooter comes on the heels of dozens of similar reports, with the most recent arriving in the form of air traffic control audio that directly stated that there were active shooters on the runway. \u201cDuring the air traffic control recordings, which were released by political strategist and co-founder of \u201cThe New Right\u201d Mike Tokes, one of the dispatchers is heard telling an incoming plane that landing might not be a good idea because there were multiple active shooters on the airport property itself,\u201d SHTFplan reported. \u201cShutting down might not be a good idea, there\u2019s active shooters on the runway,\u201d he declared. \u201cThe 19s are closed, we are in the process of trying to round them up, they are on the airport property.\u201d Air traffic control tapes on the night of the Las Vegas shooting: \u201cThere\u2019s active shooters on the runway.

Kritarch Patti Saris, who thinks it is the job of District Court judges to micromanage the deportation system of the United States, got her wish. One of the Indonesian illegal aliens benefiting from her little amnesty took the hint and used the opportunity that Saris created to flee from arrest and deportation, absconding to a sanctuary church to hide from arrest. Kritarch Patti Saris Saris like many other Federal judges does not like our current immigration system and wants another system more to her liking. One of those likings is an unlimited number of hearings as to previously denied asylum claims. Carrying his 3-year-old daughter in his arms, Yohanes Tasik scoped out the church classroom he indefinitely would call home. The Indonesian Christian, facing mounting pressure to report to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, took refuge Friday night inside the Reformed Church of Highland Park. He is the third Indonesian Christian who claimed sanctuary within the church in fear of deportation. [Indonesian Immigrant Finds Sanctuary In N.J. Church, by Steph Solis, USA Today, January 16, 2018] Saris should know that when the appeal of her decision that the Indonesian illegal aliens gets reviewed by the Supreme Court, her decision will be struck down. So she seem to have acted to encourage the illegal aliens in the case she is managing to see the writing on the wall, and use her order prohibiting their arrest and deportation to flee the authorities.Even the illegal aliens know that minor kritarchs have no authority over deportations, especially those that have been fully adjudicated and any claim of asylum found to be without any basis so they are taking up other options to fight deportation, like fleeing and hiding. A federal judge on Wednesday signaled she may extend an order preventing the deportation of roughly 50 Indonesian Christians living illegally in New Hampshire, a process that immigration officials began after U.S. President Donald Trump took office. U.S. District Judge Patti Saris in Boston expressed concern the Indonesians could be deported before their administrative appeals were finished, given their claims they could face religious persecution in the world\u2019s largest majority-Muslim nation. [U.S. Judge May Extend Freeze On Indonesian Immigrants' Deportation, by Nate Raymond, Reuters, January 17, 2018] Federal officials contend they have always had the authority to deport them at any time. \u201cThere\u2019s no legal basis for them to ask for more time,\u201d Vinita Andrapalliyal, a U.S. Justice Department lawyer, argued in court on Wednesday. Federal law gives authority over immigration matters to the executive branch, not the courts. Over the Justice Department\u2019s objections, Saris last year ruled she had jurisdiction over the case. She entered a temporary order blocking the Indonesians\u2019 deportation until she could decide whether to impose a preliminary injunction. Ronaldo Rauseo-Ricupero, a lawyer for the Indonesians, argued they should have 90 days to move to reopen their cases after receiving copies of their administrative case files and time to appeal any decision rejecting those motions. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to put them on a ship back unless someone has had chance to look at if there\u2019s a really bad situation for them,\u201d Saris said. \u201cThat\u2019s my concern.\u201d And Kritarch Saris has not stopped. She is moving forward with more orders to halt deportation of illegal aliens.Kritarch Saris just does not accept that the immigration courts found no basis for their claim of persecution, and there is no evidence that they would face persecution today. She and other kritarchs have acted outside the law, something that the reporter surprisingly puts in the story.And the Treason Bar attorney demanded that Kritarch Saris create a whole new second immigration appeals system of unlimited delay for these illegal aliens.Kritarch Saris thinks that her feelings about a deportation are the same as the law.Well, that is not Kritarch Saris' concern. The concern over persecution overseas is reviewed by the Executive Branch, and that decision was entered--there is no \"bad situation\" for her to be concerned about. And Saris is not the only kritarch that thinks they run immigration policy--Mark Goldsmith thinks he runs immigration policy as well. A federal judge in Michigan has ordered the government to give bond hearings in preparation for releasing hundreds of illegal immigrants from Iraq into the community, saying the Constitution protects them from indefinite detention in the U.S. U.S. District Judge Mark A Goldsmith, an Obama appointee, earlier had halted deportations for nearly 300 Iraqis, saying that although they had long been ordered removed, conditions on the ground in Iraq had changed and they deserved new hearings. His latest ruling Tuesday evening goes further, certifying some of the Iraqis as a class-action lawsuit and saying most of them should be \u201callowed to return to their productive lives\u201d while they wait for new hearings \u2014 meaning they must be released from detention unless the government can prove they are a major risk to public safety. [Judge Orders Potential Release Of Hundreds Of Illegals From Iraq, by Stephen Dinan, Washington Times, January 3, 2018] He is ordering the release of hundreds of Iraqi illegal aliens and criminal aliens, all because he wants them to have another bite at the apple--they, like the Indonesians, lost claims to political asylum years ago. Kritarch Mark Goldsmith Both these kritarchs are part of illegal and unconstitutional #Resistance to the lawful immigration policies of President Trump. Illegal aliens get only one hearing and one set of appeals to deportation. They don't get another new and illegal set of hearings and appeals just because some minor kritarch wants something. Time for Congress to end this by prohibiting review of immigration and deportation decisions.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

During this operation, ERO deportation officers made arrests in the following Missouri cities: St. Joseph (6), Belton (1), Blue Springs (1), Independence (2) and Kansas City (6). ICE officers also made arrests in the Kansas cities of Olathe (3) and Lawrence (1). Fifteen men and five women, ages ranging 18-61, were arrested. Aliens arrested during this operation are from the following countries: Brazil (1), El Salvador (3), Guatemala (6), Honduras (1), Mexico (7), Romania (1) and Sierra Leone (1). Several of the aliens targeted by ERO deportation officers during this operation had prior criminal histories that included driving under the influence, child neglect, child abuse, drug offenses, fraud and larceny. Four of these were arrested for illegally re-entering the United States after having been deported, which is a felony. Two overstayed lawful visits to the U.S. All were amenable to arrest and removal under the U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act. The following are criminal summaries of some of the offenders arrested in the Kansas City area during this operation: A 55-year-old, Mexican citizen who overstayed a lawful visit to the U.S. by more than 12 years. She was arrested Feb. 26, 2018 in Johnson County Kansas. She was previously convicted of child neglect and was sentenced to a year in jail. She is currently in ICE custody pending removal proceedings. On Feb. 28, 2018, a 38-year-old Mexican citizen was arrested in Olathe, Kansas. He has a 2012 conviction for fraud. He was issued a warrant of removal and was placed in ICE custody pending removal from the United States. Depending on an alien\u2019s criminality, an alien who re-enters the United States after having been previously deported commits a felony punishable by up to 20 years in federal prison, if convicted. \u201cThe continued results of our deportation officers underscore ICE\u2019s ongoing and steady commitment to public safety,\u201d said Ricardo Wong, field office director for ERO Chicago. \u201cAs part of this operation, we continue focus on the arrest of individuals who are criminal aliens and public safety threats. Because of the tireless efforts of these professional officers, there are fewer criminals in our communities.\u201d\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

But Jewish groups on and off campus have denounced the report as flawed, saying it missed the significance of an anti-Semitic text circulated online before Noah Lew was removed from the board last fall. A joint statement from five campus Jewish groups says the report, released this week by principal Suzanne Fortier, \u201cappears to condone discrimination against Jewish students at McGill based on the cultural and religious organizations they affiliate with.\u201d The controversy has its roots in McGill\u2019s long-running debate over the anti-Israel Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement. At an Oct. 23 general assembly of the Student Society of McGill University, a routine motion to elect a slate of directors turned contentious. Supporters of a group called Democratize SSMU, formed to fight a decision of the board of directors declaring BDS counter to the SSMU constitution, brought a motion to divide the election vote. In the past they had been ratified as a bloc. The first five candidates were overwhelmingly approved, but when they got to Lew, the only Jewish director, he was rejected 105 to 73. In a subsequent Facebook post, Lew wrote, \u201cMy Jewish identity was now public, and a target was placed squarely upon me by the McGill BDS movement.\u201d An outcry followed, leading Fortier to appoint former Ombudsperson for Students, Spencer Boudreau, to investigate. She also created a Task Force on Respect and Inclusion in Campus Life and a support line to report incidents of intolerance. Boudreau interviewed 38 students over his three-and-a-half week investigation. His findings, he wrote, do \u201cnot substantiate the notion that the vote was motivated by anti-Semitism,\u201d which he defined as hostility toward or discrimination against Jews. Rather, he found, votes against Lew were \u201cmotivated by politics, that is, based on his support for Israel and Zionism and/or for his view of the BDS movement.\u201d Protests about Israel\u2019s policies cannot be equated with anti-Semitism, Boudreau wrote, though he said Lew\u2019s belief that he was targeted because he was Jewish was \u201chonest and even understandable.\u201d A statement Wednesday by Hillel McGill, Chabad at McGill and three other Jewish groups said Boudreau was mistaken about the timing of an anti-Semitic message posted online by Democratize SSMU. Boudreau\u2019s report said the message followed the assembly vote, but in fact it was posted at the beginning of October. Democratize SSMU deleted the message, which targeted Lew and two other candidates, after the meeting and apologized for publishing material that was \u201cinsensitive to anti-Semitic tropes of Jewish people as corrupt and politically powerful.\u201d The Jewish groups said this anti-Semitic rhetoric \u201cwas used to encourage students to vote specifically against Noah Lew. It is under this context that the (general assembly) occurred, and the report fundamentally misunderstands this, which alters the entire findings of the report.\u201d They say Boudreau\u2019s report \u201cinsinuates that Jewish students who engage with mainstream Jewish community organizations are permitted to be precluded from holding political office.\u201d Lew was restored to his post as a director last month after a ruling that the split vote in October had violated the SSMU constitution. He was not immediately available for comment. Michael Mostyn, CEO of B\u2019nai Brith Canada, called the report a whitewash. \u201cThe report does not present a full or accurate picture of the hostile atmosphere facing Jewish students at McGill,\u201d he said in a statement. Fortier said the university\u2019s next actions will be based on the recommendations of the Task Force on Respect and Inclusion in Campus Life, due to report in April. \u201cI would like to take this opportunity to make it clear that there is absolutely no place for anti-Semitism at McGill University and that, as principal and vice-chancellor, I will remain vigilant to ensure that all members of our community feel safe, welcomed and respected on our campuses,\u201d she said in a statement. \u2022 Email: ghamilton@nationalpost.com | Twitter: grayhamilton\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

On August 5, 1964, the New York Times reported, \u201cPresident Johnson has ordered retaliatory action against gunboats and \u2018certain supporting facilities in North Vietnam\u2019 after renewed attacks against American destroyers in the Gulf of Tonkin.\u201d Additional outlets, such as the Washington Post, echoed this claim. But it wasn\u2019t true. At all. In fact, the Gulf of Tonkin incident, as it became known, turned out to be a fictitious creation courtesy of the government to escalate war in Vietnam \u2014 leading to the deaths of tens of thousands of U.S. troops and millions of Vietnamese, fomenting the largest anti-war movement in American history, and tarnishing the reputation of a nation once considered at least somewhat noble in the eyes of the world. take our poll - story continues below Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?

In 2010, more than 1,100 transcripts from the Vietnam era were released, proving Congress and officials raised serious doubts about the information fed to them by the Pentagon and White House. But while this internal grumbling took place, mainstream media dutifully reported official statements as if the veracity of the information couldn\u2019t be disputed. Tom Wells, author of the exhaustive expos\u00e9 \u201cThe War Within: America\u2019s Battle Over Vietnam,\u201d explained the media egregiously erred in \u201calmost exclusive reliance on U.S. government officials as sources of information\u201d and \u201creluctance to question official pronouncements on \u2018national security issues.\u2019\u201d If due diligence had been performed, and reporters had raised appropriate doubts about the Gulf of Tonkin false flag, it\u2019s arguable whether support for the contentious war would have lasted as long as it did. Sadly, the United States has a tendency to repeat the same mistakes over and over again. And now, a US Army Colonel is predicting that another Gulf of Tonkin incident could bring us into war with Iran. As President Donald Trump continues to surround himself with neocon warhawks, the drums are beating for war with Iran. The rhetoric is becoming so strong, that Trump himself \u2014 without provocation \u2014 began tweeting threats to the sovereign nation. On Tuesday, Fox News host Tucker Carlson and Colonel Douglas Macgregor addressed the growing prospect of US war with Iran and warned that a new \u201cGulf of Tonkin incident\u201d could be used to drag us into it. Carlson mocked the neocons\u2019 claims that Iran is the \u201cgreatest threat\u201d to America, explicitly noting that \u201cvirtually every attack in America has been inspired not by Iran, but by Iran\u2019s Sunni enemies.\u201d Carlson pointed out how the neocons are hellbent on pushing the Trump administration into a new war. \u201cIf there was ever a swamp in Washington you are looking at it \u2014 the foreign policy establishment \u2014 they are working overtime to ensnare the president in a mess in Iran,\u201d Carlson said. \u201cLet\u2019s hope that he understands exactly what\u2019s going on.\u201d Pointing out Trump\u2019s recent attempts at diplomacy with North Korea and Russia, Col. Macgregor weighed in, noting that he thinks Trump will attempt to avoid war with Iran. However, he noted that a false flag could be used to drag us into it. \u201cI think the president needs to watch carefully for the potential for something like the Gulf of Tonkin incident,\u201d Col. Macgregor said. \u201cMany of your viewers may not remember that it never happened and we could very well be treated to something like that in the Gulf. We should watch for that, and this is an example of President Trump\u2019s comments on fake news, he should not be sabotage by fake news.\u201d Carlson then pointed out how the Trump admin has reacted to fake news by attacking Syria\u2014twice. For those who may be unaware, the plan to overthrow Iran has long been in the works. In fact, in April 2012, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, Seymour Hersh reported that the U.S. Joint Special Operations Command had trained (Mojahedin-e Khalq) MEK operatives at a secret site in Nevada from 2005 to 2009. MEK is the Iranian political-militant organization that advocates for the violent overthrow of the current Iranian regime. They are hardly quiet about it. According to Hersh, MEK members were trained in intercepting communications, cryptography, weaponry and small unit tactics at the Nevada site until President Barack Obama took office in 2009. Hersh also reported additional names of former U.S. officials paid to speak in support of MEK, including former CIA directors James Woolsey and Porter Goss; New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani; former Vermont Governor Howard Dean; former Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation Louis Freeh and former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton. Coincidentally, MEK was classified as a terrorist organization by the United States and its allies\u2014during this training period\u2014until they suddenly removed them from the list in 2012. While the current Iranian regime is certainly no bastion of freedom, the idea that US intervention or a violent revolution would be beneficial for the people of Iran is outright insane. To see what US intervention\u2014through military support and the support of \u2018protesters\u2019\u2014does to countries, one need only look at Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya to see the horrific\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

In fact, I've often said if we catch people close to the border, we should not even bring them into the system if they are not citizens, but walk them back over the border and make sure they keep walking. Often, by putting illegals into the system, it takes years to deport them, which costs the American people lots of money. That system would require more judges to handle more illegals and Trump ripped the calls for more judges in favor of a more \"simple immigration plan.\" \u201cWe want strong borders and we want no crime,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe Democrats want open borders and they don\u2019t care about crime.\u201d Trump then called on Congress to correct the problems created by legislation with more legislation. \u201cThe laws are obsolete, the laws are horrible, having to do with the border, both in terms of security and in terms of taking care of people,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want children staying together,\u201d Trump said, blasting the New York Times report that said he didn't really want to sign his executive order last week that would keep families together in detention while they awaited the judicial process. Of course, Trump has inherited a problem that has existed for several administrations, both Republican and Democrat, for decades. It is time that Congress sure up things so that America's tax dollars are not bound up in a worthless judicial process when people are clearly in the country illegally.

It was held at the Radisson South Hotel, Minneapolis, on Tuesday, May 12, 1976, and its stated purpose was to assist the Archbishop in gaining a stronger foothold for the Society of St. Pius X in the States during the unprecedented crisis Blessed Pope Paul had helped unleash on the Church. I\u2019m posting the address here because I'm convinced the Archbishop\u2019s words provide recent recruits to Tradition with vital historical context for the diabolical debacle that is the pontificate of Pope Francis. And for those of us who\u2019ve been in the trenches for a long, long time it also provides welcome reminder of why we must continue to fight. Even though I personally was in attendance back in 1976 when Archbishop Lefebvre delivered this address in Minneapolis, I was only ten years old and of course didn't realize how prophetic he was on that occasion, or how devastated by the Second Vatican Council, the New Mass, and the Freemasonic infiltration of the Vatican. In fact, this transcript reads like a message of encouragement at a crucial moment in the history of this movement\u2014Stay in the fight! Keep the Faith. Never surrender! This address also makes it absolutely clear that everything Archbishop Lefebvre did was part of an eleventh-hour defence of the Kingship of Christ (ignored completely by the Second Vatican Council) and a desperate last stand for Tradition, the infallible teachings of Mother Church and of course her ancient liturgy. And now that Pope Francis has inadvertently unmasked the true spirit of Vatican II, it becomes obvious how and why those who resisted that spirit were right to have done so and will certainly be hailed by history as the heroic band of Catholic brothers that mounted the twentieth century\u2019s last stand for Christ the King and, while scorned and mocked at the time, were nevertheless totally vindicated fifty years later. May we continue to earn the right to stand with them today. MJM The Archbishop Speaks Ladies and Gentlemen: As I said to Mr. [Walter] Matt, I can say in bad English what he says in good English, because he said all of the things I want to say [Referring here to Walter Matt\u2019s introductory talk referenced above.] And I thank you, Mr. Matt, very much, for his invitation, and I thank you for your coming, and I thank Fr. Ward for what he said about the Society of St. Pius X. And I hope that you can understand my poor English, but I think it is better to speak some bad English because to translate would take too much time. As Mr. Matt said, the crisis in the Church is very extraordinary. It is very difficult to understand the situation today. My seminary in Econe (in Switzerland) and the seminaries in Germany and here in America, in Armada, are in very difficult situations with Rome. Why? These seminaries are the same as seminaries were before the Second Vatican Council. They have the same discipline and the same studies, they make good priests; I think they are good seminarians. All is done as all the seminaries before the Second Vatican Council. Why are we now in this very sad situation with Rome? I think that because in the Second Vatican Council, and after the Council, there is a mutation, a change, in the Church. But we do not change. We continue the Tradition. So why do they now say, as Mgr. (Archbishop) Benelli[1] said to me months ago on the 19th of March, \u201cyou are out of communion with the Church.\u201d I am out of communion with the Church because I continue the Tradition of the Church? This is possible? I do not understand. Why? I have done nothing. I believe nothing other than what the Church has believed for twenty centuries. Mgr. Benelli then said to me, you must put down in a writing to the Holy Father that you accept the Second Vatican Council, you accept the reform that followed the Council, and that you accept the orientations that have been given by Rome. Mgr. Benelli took the book of the New Ordo, gave it to me, and said, \u201cYou must say this New Mass in all of your houses.\u201d I wonder why Mgr. Benelli did not communicate this condition to me before our meeting.[2] He could have done so. For example, one year ago three cardinals sent me a letter (Cardinals Wright, Tabera [Arturo Carinal Tabera Araoz, one of the Council Fathers MJM], and Gabriel-Marie Garrone) telling me (in effect) that I must close the seminaries. Well, I refused, because I refuse to contribute to the destruction of the Church. Because now they are destroying the Church. When I die and go before the judge, God will not be able to say to me, \u201cYou destroyed the Church.\u201d I refused to contribute to the destruction of the Church. I am sure that my seminaries are contributing to the restoration of the Church. I do not destroy the Church. And so I said to Mgr. Benelli, \u201cNo, I will not sign that writing.\u201d I think that the mutation in the Church came in through the Second Vatican Council. And do you think this change in the Church came suddenly? When, then? At the beginning of the Council? No, this change in the Church began one century before [the Council]. Pope Pius VI said during the French Revolution that if the Church continues to remain under the influence of the prince of the revolution, then, in the future a crisis will come upon the Church.

Over the last month multiple videos have been released that many believe show helicopters either conducting an attack on the Vegas Strip or attempting to stop those that were and now, with this latest evidence release, that possibility seems all the more plausible. As Shepard Ambellas reported for Intellihub, \u201cThe [footage] is presumed to have been captured by a nearby business\u2019s southward facing security camera which is located approximately 780 feet due east of the venue where the Route 91 Harvest Music Festival was held on Oct. 1. The tape was given to Fox News by an attorney who represents several shooting victims.\u201d Amazingly, the surveillance camera captured what seems to show a \u201clarge amount\u201d of wind and debris being kicked up by a nearby helicopter hovering above the attack and or taking part in it. \u201cAstonishingly, between the times of 10:13 and 10:16 a good amount of debris can be seen being pushed downward and sideways in front of the camera,\u201d Ambellas continued. \u201cBy 10:14 much larger crowds of people can be seen streaming through the area to escape the massacre going on,\u201d Carlson reported. \u201cYou can see a large amount of wind and debris, apparently that is due to a helicopter hovering overhead.\u201d The footage goes how to show two men attempt to help a victim who had apparently been shot, eventually resorting to covering up the body after they realized it was simply too late. Ambellas also reported on what his research indicates were documented helicopters in the air at the time. A quick review of flight records during that time reveals that a squadron of EC-130 Eurocopters departed from Maverick Leasing LLC at 10:12 p.m., several of which appear to have overflown the parking lot where the victim and debris were seen. However, the departure of the choppers and the fact that several of them overflew the parking lot does not explain all of the debris being kicked up from by a heavy downdraft, prop wash, possibly from a helicopter hovering in place much closer. In fact, the downdraft appears to be constant from 10:13-10:16 p.m. and not intermittent as if several choppers had just passed overhead. As I have reported in the past, multiple other videos taken on the night of the attack also seem to point to helicopters being used throughout the city. \u201cFootage has emerged that may show muzzle flashes coming from the helicopter in what looks to be evidence that a team was firing into the crowd from the air on that fateful night,\u201d read a report in The Daily Sheeple. \u201cDespite claims by some that these are \u201cstrobes\u201d it remains unlikely that this is the case, especially when you consider other footage of the helicopter taken on the night as well as research by a group of investigators who believe the first attack on October 1st was carried out from the air.\u201d It is also important to keep in mind that there is footage of a still unidentified team loading up gear in a helicopter near the scene of the attack. \u201cIn what can only be described as a \u201cWTF video\u201d the following footage seems to literally show a team of unknown soldiers gearing up next to a helicopter near the Route 91 concert.\u201d Additionally, Carlson also noted during the initial broadcast of the private surveillance footage that the owner of the camera was never approached by the FBI, who have so far never seen the footage, much less investigated it. While we may never know what actually happened during the Las Vegas Massacre, the fact remains that the official story has been proven, time and time again, to be absolutely false and in fact nothing more than a pathetic attempt at a cover-up.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

The Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors lapsed in December, when its members\u2019 terms expired, prompting concerns that the advisory body could be disbanded. In addition to O\u2019Malley\u2019s return as the panel\u2019s president, Pope Francis named seven returning members and nine new members representing countries around the world, including Brazil, the Netherlands, Ethiopia, and India, according to a statement from the Vatican.

Sign up for more newsletters here O\u2019Malley, the archbishop of Boston, said in the statement that the pope had \u201cgiven much prayerful consideration\u201d to the membership of the panel. \u201cThe newly appointed members will add to the Commission\u2019s global perspective in the protection of minors and vulnerable adults,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Holy Father has ensured continuity in the work of our Commission, which is to assist local churches throughout the world in their efforts to safeguard all children, young people, and vulnerable adults from harm.\u201d Local survivors of abuse greeted the announcement warily, hopeful that there could be positive change in the church but saying the panel accomplished little under its first three-year mandate. \u201cThe objectives of the commission when it was first announced, when it was just getting started. . . were never fulfilled,\u201d said Phil Saviano, an abuse survivor who founded the New England chapter of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests. Advertisement Saviano said the commission is \u201ca good idea,\u201d and added, \u201cI\u2019m not particularly optimistic that much will get accomplished, but a commission is better than no commission.\u201d Given his long experience witnessing the church\u2019s inertia on the issue, Saviano said, he has set his expectations at rock bottom. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of my attitude now: If I don\u2019t expect the Catholic Church to do anything, then I won\u2019t be too disappointed when they don\u2019t do anything,\u201d he continued. Jim Scanlan, another survivor, said \u201cthe timing of it is too perfect\u201d given the controversy last month surrounding Pope Francis\u2019s remarks that accused victims of a notorious Chilean pedophile priest, the Rev. Fernando Karadima, of \u201cslander\u201d against Bishop Juan Barros, who the victims say was complicit in a cover up. The pope said he had seen no proof of Barros\u2019s guilt, but the Associated Press reported that O\u2019Malley and other members of the commission had in 2015 hand-delivered to him an eight-page letter from a survivor that graphically detailed his abuse and said Barros and other clergy had witnessed him being fondled but had not intervened. Advertisement Scanlan said his reaction to hearing that Francis has revived the commission was \u201chopeful but cynical.\u201d Like Saviano, he said the panel accomplished little in its first incarnation. \u201cMy expectation is it will probably have the same outcome, because the church is the church, and they do it for appearance, but they\u2019re still going to go by their own rules,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen little that has changed.\u201d Scanlan said Pope Francis has given him hope for progress on some issues in the church, but on sexual abuse, he \u201ccontinues to be blind to what the church has done.\u201d Last month, O\u2019Malley denounced the pope\u2019s controversial defense of the Chilean bishop. Despite distancing himself from Pope Francis\u2019s comments, O\u2019Malley said that he has witnessed the pontiff\u2019s genuine compassion for abuse victims. \u201cThe Pope\u2019s statements that there is no place in the life of the Church for those who would abuse children and that we must adhere to zero tolerance for these crimes are genuine,\u201d O\u2019Malley said, \u201cand they are his commitment.\u201d Jeremy C.

Eleven children ranging in age from 1 to 15-years-old were also taken in protective custody and later turned over to New Mexico Children Youth and Families Department (CYFD) for their own health and safety. Three women believed to be the children\u2019s mothers were also arrested. Thursday afternoon Sheriff Jerry Hogrefe swore out an affidavit for a search warrant that states there is a makeshift compound surrounded by tires and an earthen berm in Costilla Meadows subdivision that he reasonably believed was occupied by adult Lucas Morton and others, including 39-year-old Siraj Wahhaj, who was wanted for child abduction and 3-year-old AG Wahhaj, the child that was abducted. This warrant came after a two-month investigation in conjunction with Clayton County, Georgia and FBI investigators. According to Sheriff Hogrefe the FBI had recently provided information and surveillance on this location, but they (FBI) didn\u2019t feel there was enough probable cause to get on the property. In the press release Sheriff Hogrefe said, \u201cThat all changed for me when a message was forwarded to us from a Georgia Detective that we reasonably believed came from someone at the compound \u2013 the message sent to a third party simply said in part \u201cwe are starving and need food and water\u201d. I absolutely knew that we couldn\u2019t wait on another agency to step up and we had to go check this out as soon as possible, so I began working on a search warrant right after I got that intercepted message \u2013 it had to be a search warrant and a tactical approach for our own safety because we had learned the occupants were most likely heavily armed and considered extremist of the Muslim belief. We also knew from the layout of the compound they would have an advantage if we didn\u2019t deploy tactfully and quickly.\u201d On Friday morning, August 3, 2018, eight members of TCSO\u2019s Sheriff\u2019s Response Team (SRT) were assisted by four members of the State OSI unit when they executed the search warrant. The \u201call day\u201d operation went without major incident or any injuries, but when encountered both men initially refused to follow verbal direction and Wahhaj who was held up inside the compound was heavily armed with an AR15 rifle, five loaded 30 round magazines, and four loaded pistols, including one in his pocket when he was taken down. Many more rounds of ammo were found in the makeshift compound that consists of a small travel trailer buried in the ground covered by plastic with no water, plumbing, or electricity. \u201cThe only food We saw were a few potatoes and a box of rice in the filthy trailer,\u201d said Hogrefe. \u201cBut what was most surprising, and heartbreaking was when the team located a total of five adults and 11 children that looked like third world country refugees not only with no food or fresh water, but with no shoes, personal hygiene and basically dirty rags for clothing.\u201d The body of a yound boy was also located, however, it is not clear if the boy is the missing child from Georgia. Both males were arrested; Morton was charged with harboring a fugitive and Wahhaj was booked on his no bond Georgia warrant for child abduction. The three females believed to be the mothers of the eleven children, Jany Leveille age 35, Hujrah Wahhaj age 38, and Subhannah Wahhaj age 35 were arrested without incident in Taos and were later booked in the Taos Adult Detention Center. \u201cWe all gave the kids our water and what snacks we had \u2013 it was the saddest living conditions and poverty I have seen.\u201d None of the adults would give statement to the current whereabouts of AG Wahhaj, but it is reasonably believed he was there a few weeks ago. The investigation is fluid and ongoing. Advertisements comments\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

It's because it implicates dozens of House Democrats in what could be the biggest crime of spying in US history by Muslim IT spy Imran Awan and his partners. Former head of the Democratic National Committee, Debbie Wasserman Schultz is on the front line of aiding and abetting Awan and his associates as has been revealed by Luke Rosiak of The Daily Caller. In a lengthy report by Rosiak at The Daily Caller News Foundation, he writes: take our poll - story continues below Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?

Ex-Democratic National Committee head Debbie Wasserman Schultz said she intervened in a Pakistani land deal involving her then\u2013IT aide Imran Awan, according to two House employees. The dispute came after Awan\u2019s father was charged with fraud in relation to the deal, and the mysterious exertion of political influence resulted in Pakistani authorities instead targeting the elderly alleged victims, according to a local report. And when a House Office of Inspector General cybersecurity investigation found that Awan made \u201cunauthorized access\u201d to House servers, including the House Democratic Caucus\u2019 shortly before the election, Wasserman Schultz became \u201cfrantic, not normal,\u201d \u201cmaking the rounds\u201d to House officials in an attempt to kill the investigation, one House employee told The Daily Caller News Foundation. Awan told people Wasserman Schultz chose the name for his daughter, Leza \u2014 a Jewish name \u2014 and that the Florida congresswoman\u2019s daughter regularly rode a horse that Awan kept at a boarding facility, sources with knowledge of the relationship told TheDCNF. Wasserman Schultz cornered House Chief Administrative Officer Phil Kiko and called him a \u201cfucking Islamophobe,\u201d saying \u201cyou will not so much as take away their parking spots,\u201d the two House employees said Kiko told them. The congresswoman also told Kiko she had invited Awan\u2019s whole family to her daughter\u2019s bat mitzvah and said she had \u201chelped him with a land deal,\u201d the sources said. A spokesman for Kiko declined to comment on this story. A 2009 article in the Pakistani publication Dawn, headlined \u201cInfluential expat shields father from long arm of law,\u201d said Awan\u2019s father was facing criminal fraud charges involving a land deal, but Awan used political connections to pressure the police into targeting the alleged victims instead. Awan\u2019s father purchased \u201chuge chunks of land from different farmers in 2008,\u201d but all the checks bounced, the report said. \u201cThe police high-ups are \u2018ominously\u2019 indifferent to proceed against Awan,\u201d and it\u2019s \u201cnoteworthy\u201d how they were \u201ccomplying with the desires of\u201d Awan, who the paper described as a \u201cWhite House employee.\u201d \u201cAbout a dozen farmers of Chak 7-JB, Panjor, including five siblings \u2014 all aged between 57 and 70 \u2014 have given up hope of justice after they sold their agricultural lands to Ashraf Awan of Bole De Jhugi, who is father of White House employee Shahid Imran,\u201d Dawn reported. Imran Awan also goes by Shahid Imran Awan, Virginia court records show. The police harassed the 19 would-be victims, including the five elderly brothers and even their lawyer, and charged them with \u201cfrivolous\u201d cases, apparently to get them to stop trying to get the money they say they were owed, the paper said. \u201cMohammad Abid, a victim of [Ashraf] Awan\u2019s alleged high-profile swindling, said that [Ashraf] Awan\u2019s son had easy access to the corridors of power and that\u2019s why he was able to [pressure] the police to dance to his tunes,\u201d Dawn reported. The article details a series of people who say they were then subject to retaliation, including widow Bushra Bibi who said, \u201cnow Imran was threatening her with dire consequences.\u201d A third source, who\u2019s familiar with Imran Awan, told TheDCNF that Awan recounted the intervention in the foreign criminal matter and that Awan said it was Wasserman Schultz who intervened. A fourth source \u2014 a fellow House IT aide \u2014 previously told TheDCNF that Awan said now-Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel wasinvolved. Dr. Zafar Iqbal, one of the alleged victims, told TheDCNF that \u201cImran came to Pakistan to get [his father] out of jail, since he had some [connections] in the Congress.\u201d Ashraf Awan\u2019s business partner in the land deal, Rashid Minhas, told TheDCNF that the elder Awan gave a USB to a Pakistani senator who is a former head of a Pakistani intelligence agency, and that Imran claimed his IT position in Congress gave him the power to \u201cchange the U.S. president.\u201d Minhas is in prison for an unrelated fraud charge. On July 25, 2016, the House Inspector General notified the Committee on House Administration that investigators had detected major cybersecurity violations by the Awan family. Awan, his wife, two brothers, his brother\u2019s wife, and even his elderly father were all being paid by various Democrats to manage their servers, with many of the members from Wasserman Schultz\u2019s Florida. The finding came at a critical time for Democrats: It was three days after WikiLeaks published the first emails from a hacked on the DNC, setting the stage for Wasserman Schultz to lose her position as party chair and for Democrats to begin electioneering on a theme of Russian hacking.

None of these are eligible asylum claims, Breitbart reports. According to the New York Times, lawyers with the National Lawyers Guild, a Soros-backed organization, are aiding the caravan migrants before they attempt to seek asylum in the U.S.: Others have begun to deal in practicalities, walking a mile from the shelter to enter their names on a waiting list for an asylum interview.

Of course, the best coverage of this is from\u2026Russia. Sputnik News contacted many of the alternative journalists who were purged to get their take on what happened. You may recall that basically every blogger outside the establishment media was accused of being secretly Russian during the 2016 election by the Washington Post, so perhaps actual Russians have a vested interest in the truth coming out on this topic. My friend John Vibes is an amazing person who contributes to The Free Thought Project. He said: This signifies a re-consolidation of the media. Cable news media controlled the narrative for most of modern history, but the internet has lowered that barrier to entry and allowed the average person to become the media themselves. This obviously took market share and influence away from the traditional media, and it has allowed for a more diverse public conversation. Now it seems the platforms that have monopolized the industry are favoring mainstream sources and silencing alternative voices. So now, instead of allowing more people to have a voice, these platforms are creating an atmosphere where only powerful media organizations are welcome, just as we had on cable news. People think that we are just providing an activist spin on the news, but they don\u2019t see the families struggling to have their voice heard. For example, when someone is shot by police, mainstream media sources often just republish the press release from the police department, without presenting the victim\u2019s side of the story. We give the victims and their families a voice, which is essential to keep power in check. This also goes for bigger issues like foreign policy as well; multiple full-scale invasions of Syria have been prevented because of information that the alternative media made viral.

It has become a superdogma in the Catholic Church: if you don\u2019t believe that Islam is a Religion of Peace, you will be ruthlessly harassed and silenced by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and the hierarchy elsewhere as well. The bishops of the Catholic Church are much more concerned that you believe that Islam is a religion of peace than that you believe in, say, the Nicene Creed. And the Pope is almost certain to ignore this heartfelt appeal, as he has ignored others who have respectfully questioned his departures from Catholic teaching. I have yet to meet a Catholic prelate who believes that the requirement to treat all charitably applies to those who hold opinions that have been deemed unacceptable. \u201cLeave them; they are blind guides. And if a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into a pit.\u201d (Matthew 15:14) \u201cIslamic Converts Ask Pope in Open Letter To Change His Teaching on Islam,\u201d by Steve Skojec, OnePeterFive.com, January 11, 2018: A new, open letter to the pope is making the rounds on the Internet, and it has gathered over 2,600 signatures so far. \u201cMost Holy Father,\u201d it begins, \u201c\u202cMany of us \u202chave tried to contact you, \u202con many occasions \u202cand for several years, \u202cand we have never received the slightest acknowledgement of our letters or requests for meetings.\u201d The letter is not from the dubia cardinals, or from the more than 800,000 signers of the 2015 Filial Appeal, or from the signatories of the Filial Correction, but from a group of Islamic converts to Catholicism, who want Francis to answer a simple question: why did they literally risk their lives to become Catholic if Islam is \u201ca good religion in itself\u201d as the pope \u201cseems to teach\u201d? It\u2019s a question he refuses to answer, despite endless platitudes of how important it is to be close to the marginalized and to accompany those on the peripheries of the Church. The signers, however, are not dissuaded in their pursuit of a paternal answer: You do not like to beat around the bush, and neither do we, so allow us to say frankly that we do not understand your teaching about Islam, as we read in paragraphs 252 and 253 of Evangelii Gaudium, because it does not account for the fact that Islam came AFTER Christ, and so is, and can only be, an Antichrist (see 1 Jn 2.22), and one of the most dangerous because it presents itself as the fulfillment of Revelation (of which Jesus would have been only a prophet). If Islam is a good religion in itself, as you seem to teach, why did we become Catholic? Do not your words question the soundness of the choice we made at the risk of our lives? Islam prescribes death for apostates (Quran 4.89, 8.7-11), do you know? How is it possible to compare Islamic violence with so-called Christian violence? \u201cWhat is the relationship between Christ and Satan? What union is there between light and darkness? What association between the faithful and the unfaithful?\u201d (2 Cor 6: 14-17)In accordance with His teaching (Lk 14:26), we preferred Him, the Christ, to our own life. Are we not in a good position to talk to you about Islam? The letter makes short work of the notion that Islam and Christianity can ever be compatible, or that Islam can serve as a path to salvation: In fact, as long as Islam wants us to be its enemy, we are, and all our protestations of friendship cannot change anything. As a proper Antichrist, Islam exists only as an enemy of all: \u201cBetween us and you there is enmity and hatred forever, until you believe in Allah alone!\u201d (Qur\u2019an 60.4) For the Qur\u2019an, Christians \u201care only impurity\u201d (Quran 9.28),\u201d \u201cthe worst of Creation\u201d (Qur\u2019an 98.6), all condemned to Hell (Qur\u2019an 4.48), so Allah must exterminate them (Quran 9.30). We must not be deceived by the Quranic verses deemed tolerant, because they have all been repealed by the verse of the Sword (Quran 9.5). Where the Gospel proclaims the good news of Jesus\u2019 death and resurrection for the salvation of all, and the fulfillment of the Covenant initiated with the Hebrews, Allah has nothing to offer but war and murder of the \u201cinfidels\u201d in exchange for his paradise: \u201cThey fight on the way of Allah, they kill and are killed.\u201d (Quran 9:11) We do not confuse Islam with Muslims, but if for you \u201cdialogue\u201d means the voice of peace, for Islam it\u2019s only another way to make war. Also, as it was in the face of Nazism and communism, naivet\u00e9 in the face of Islam is suicidal and very dangerous. How can you speak of peace and endorse Islam, as you seem to do: \u201cTo wring from our hearts the disease that plagues our lives (\u2026) Let those who are Christians do it with the Bible and those who are Muslims do it with the Quran. \u201c(Rome, January 20, 2014)? That the Pope seems to propose the Quran as a way of salvation, is that not cause for worry? Should we return to Islam? The authors say that Islam can be no ally in the battle \u201cagainst the powers that want to dominate and enslave the world\u201d because \u201cthey share the same totalitarian logic based on the rejection of the kingship of Christ (Lk 4.7).\u201d They contest the idea that speaking in an \u201cIslamophilic tone\u201d will help those Christians who are suffering persecution in Muslim countries, professing that \u201capart from the fact that Jesus has never indicated any other way than that of the Cross, so that we\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

            "question": "Which of the following tactics is used in the following text?\n\nArticle: Trump calls on Sessions to stop Mueller\u2019s Russia probe, raising specter of attempted obstruction WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump called on Attorney General Jeff Sessions to \u201cstop this Rigged Witch Hunt right now,\u201d opening the president to further complaints that he is trying to obstruct the investigation into Russia\u2019s election interference and his campaign\u2019s possible complicity. Trump is already reportedly under investigation for potential obstruction of the Russia probe led by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III. The tweet early Wednesday was the president\u2019s most explicit post or statement to date seemingly aimed at getting his attorney general, the nation\u2019s top law enforcement officer, to end the probe The tweet, along with several others Wednesday morning, accelerated the president\u2019s attacks on the investigation, which he claims is tainted by bias. They were likely prompted by the start of the trial on Tuesday of Paul Manafort, Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, on 18 charges of tax evasion, bank fraud and conspiracy. \u201cThis is a terrible situation and Attorney General Jeff Sessions should stop this Rigged Witch Hunt right now, before it continues to stain our country any further. Bob Mueller is totally conflicted, and his 17 Angry Democrats that are doing his dirty work are a disgrace to USA!\u201d Trump wrote. The president suggested in a subsequent tweet that Manafort was being treated worse than Al Capone, the notorious Prohibition-era Chicago gangster. \u201cWhere is the Russian Collusion?\u201d Trump added. Trump\u2019s tweets prompted Rep. Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, to accuse the president of obstruction \u201chiding in plain sight.\u201d \u201cThe President of the United States just called on his Attorney General to put an end to an investigation in which the President, his family and campaign may be implicated,\u201d Schiff tweeted. \u201cThis is an attempt to obstruct justice hiding in plain sight. America must never accept it.\u201d Although the White House has said that Trump\u2019s tweets are official presidential statements, his lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, responded to the latest one as he has before, by brushing off suggestions that Trump\u2019s tweets could be used as evidence of obstruction. \u201cThe president was expressing his opinion on his favored medium for asserting his First Amendment right of free speech,\u201d Giuliani said in an interview. \u201cHe said \u2018should,\u2019 not \u2018must,\u2019 and no presidential order was issued or will be.\u201d He said he spoke with Trump to make sure that the president wasn\u2019t actually issuing an order. \u201cI talked to him about it to make sure he was on the same page as we are,\u201d Giuliani said, and the president indicated he was not ordering Sessions to act. On Sunday, Giuliani told CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d: \u201cObstruction by tweet is not something I think works real well. Generally obstruction is secret, it\u2019s clandestine, it\u2019s corrupt.\u201d Giuliani added, \u201cI\u2019ve looked at all those tweets and they don\u2019t amount to anything.\u201d For months, Trump\u2019s lawyers also have argued that it\u2019s impossible for the president to obstruct justice because his constitutional authority extends over the Justice Department. That power allows him to direct officials where to focus their resources or to fire them when he chooses, as Trump did when removing James B. Comey as FBI director last year. That firing, however, led to Mueller\u2019s appointment as special counsel. Wednesday\u2019s tweet was a reminder of Trump\u2019s unabated anger at Sessions, who recused himself from overseeing the Russia investigation on March 2, 2017 \u2014 as members of both parties and legal experts have contended that he should. Sessions pointed to Justice Department regulations to explain that, as one of Trump\u2019s earliest and most active supporters, he shouldn\u2019t participate in the investigation of the Trump campaign. He announced the decision after controversy over his own undisclosed contacts, both during the campaign and the post-election transition, with the Russian ambassador at the time, Sergey Kislyak. Two months ago, Trump tweeted that he should have chosen a different person as attorney general who wouldn\u2019t have needed to recuse himself. \u201cI wish I did!\u201d he wrote. In his tweets, Trump also quoted criticism of the investigation from Alan Dershowitz, a Harvard Law School professor who frequently defends Trump on television. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Dershowitz said he does not believe Sessions has the authority to end the probe. \u201cYou can\u2019t be both recused and making decisions about the investigation,\u201d he said. But Dershowitz also cast doubt on whether Trump\u2019s tweets can be seen as an act of obstruction. \u201cYou cannot obstruct justice by openly exercising your First Amendment rights and openly criticizing a prosecution, whether you\u2019re right or wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cObstruction of justice is generally committed behind the scenes, so I think both sides are a little overwrought here.\u201d Stephen Vladeck, a University of Texas law professor, agreed that Sessions cannot stop the Russia investigation given that he recused himself. \u201cThe president, intentionally or not, is misdirecting his ire,\u201d Vladeck said. If Trump wanted to use his power to end the probe, he would have to give the order to Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general supervising the Mueller team\u2019s work, and fire Rosenstein if he does not comply, according to Vladeck. Trump could also try to replace Sessions as attorney general with someone who does not have a conflict of interest from the campaign, allowing that person to relieve Rosenstein of the responsibility to oversee Mueller, Vladeck said. \u2014 Noah Bierman and Chris Megerian Los Angeles Times \u2014\u2014\u2014 \u00a92018 Los Angeles Times, Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

The military/security complex and the media and politicians that the complex owns have designated Russia to be that enemy. The complex and its political and media agents will not permit Trump to normalize relations with Russia. To prevent President Trump from reducing the dangerous tensions between nuclear powers that Washington has created, the military/security complex orchestrated Russiagate, a proven hoax, but believed by many due to its endless repetition. The military/security complex orchestrated the false indictments of 12 Russians. The military/security complex orchestrated the false arrest of Maria Butina, and so on and on.

We are currently experiencing sedition at the highest levels as the military/security complex unfolds its coup against the elected president of the United States. In 1961 President Dwight Eisenhower warned Americans in his last public address that the military/industrial complex was a threat to American democracy. Truer words were never spoken by an American president. Shortly thereafter, the military/security complex assassinated President John F. Kennedy for working toward peace with Soviet leader Khrushchev. To get rid of President Nixon, who made too many arms control agreements with the Soviets and opened to China, the military/security complex used its asset, the Washington Post, to orchestrate the \u201cWatergate crisis\u201d that the military/security complex used to force Nixon\u2019s resignation. Now the military/security complex is openly inciting sedition against the President of the United States. If this plot succeeds, which is the most likely case, America will be a complete dystopia and all independent voices will be shut down. Who can Trump rely on? Not on his own political party.

It was widely reported that the MEK was behind the anti-government violence that erupted in Iran in January which snowballed into the situation today. Hersh also reported additional names of former U.S. officials paid to speak in support of MEK, including former CIA directors James Woolsey and Porter Goss; New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani; former Vermont Governor Howard Dean; former Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation Louis Freeh and former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton. For over a decade, Bolton has been calling for regime change in Iran. Now, he\u2019s the National Security Advisor. It just so happens that at least one of these calls for regime change in Iran was caught on video last year as Bolton gave a speech at the Grand Gathering of Iranians for Free Iran. \u201cThere is a viable opposition to the rule of the ayatollahs, and that opposition is centered in this room today. I had said for over 10 years since coming to these events, that the declared policy of the United States of America should be the overthrow of the mullahs\u2019 regime in Tehran. The behavior and the objectives of the regime are not going to change, and therefore the only solution is to change the regime itself. And that\u2019s why, before 2019, we here will celebrate in Tehran!\u201d Pay attention to the first line in that quote above in which Bolton notes that the opposition needed to overthrow Iran\u2019s current regime \u201cis centered in this room today.\u201d Who was in that room? Well, the entire event was actually put on by the People\u2019s Mojahedin Organization of Iran, also known as the Mojahedin-e Khalq or MEK. As Politico pointed out in a 2016 article, despite the neocon attempts to rewrite history, MEK have killed Americans and committed multiple acts of terrorism. For decades, and based on U.S. intelligence, the United States government has blamed the MEK for killing three U.S. Army colonels and three U.S. contractors, bombing the facilities of numerous U.S. companies and killing innocent Iranians. To recap, the formerly terrorist-classified organization MEK, trained in the US and granted special privilege status by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2012\u2014which has since been heavily funded to refine their image by having famous US neoconservative war hawks from both sides of the isle actually chant for \u201cregime change\u201d on their behalf\u2014is now the darling child of the neocon agenda and the impetus behind what could kick of World War 3. While the current Iranian regime is certainly no bastion of freedom, the idea that US intervention or a violent revolution would be beneficial for the people of Iran or American citizens is outright insane. To see what US intervention\u2014through military support and the support of opposition groups\u2014does to countries, one need only look at Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya to see the horrific death tolls and war-ravaged dystopias left in America\u2019s wake. To those paying attention over the years, Trump\u2019s desire to intervene in Iran, and his subsequent support in the media and from all sides of the political spectrum should come as no surprise as it has been the plan since Bill Clinton was in office and was documented in the neoconservative PNAC report. This was even admitted by General Wesley Clark, former Supreme Allied Commander of NATO, that the U.S. planned on going to war with Iran, according to a 2001 memo from the U.S. Secretary of Defense. \u201cThis is a memo that describes how we\u2019re going to take out seven countries in five years,\u201d Clark said. \u201cStarting with Iraq, and then Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and finishing off with Iran.\u201d All presidents since Clinton have crossed countries off this list. Now it\u2019s Trump\u2019s turn. Article posted with permission from The Free Thought Project\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

Mohamad Jamal Khweis from Alexandria, Virginia, was convicted by a federal jury in June.

The DOJ surrendered in the matter and accepted the fact that the plans are protected under the First Amendment. However, a federal judge, in a lawsuit brought by eight states and the District of Columbia, has blocked the plans from being released. The judge should understand that these plans are protected under the First Amendment in the same way that any other printed material is, and that there is no crime that has been committed by making them available to people online. Second, if that were not enough, we already know that the Second Amendment protects actual arms from restriction and the right to keep and bear them from infringement. take our poll - story continues below Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?

Fox News has the story: U.S. District Judge Robert Lasnik issued the order a day after eight states sued the government to block a settlement reached by the Trump administration last month allowing a Texas-based company, Defense Distributed, to resume online-sharing of blueprints for the 3D firearms. The company was set to allow downloads on Wednesday, although blueprints have been posted since Friday. The temporary restraining order blocks the release until the next scheduled hearing on August 10. In the meantime, Congressional Democrats have urged President Trump to reverse the decision letting Defense Distributed publish the plans. Trump said Tuesday that he's \"looking into\" the idea, saying making 3D plastic guns available to the public \"doesn't seem to make much sense!\" Doesn't make much sense? Are you people serious? Why, yes, yes they are serious. Deadly serious. It makes perfect sense when you have the same people who have absolutely no problem with mothers hiring hitmen to murder their babies in their wombs in the most brutal and barbaric fashion, and then sell off their body parts for profit, if they don't throw them in the trash or flush them down a toilet, calling for computer files to be kept by the government and not be allowed to be released to the public. The eight states are the usual suspects, along with the District of Columbia, and we should note which ones they are. Washington Connecticut Maryland New Jersey New York Oregon Massachusetts Pennsylvania Washington's Attorney General Bob Ferguson's office claims the settlement is: ...in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act....there is no indication in the settlement agreement or elsewhere that any analysis, study or determination was made by the government defendants in consultation with other agencies, before the federal government agreed to lift export controls on the downloadable guns. In fact, the agreement states that it \"does not reflect any agreed-upon purpose other than the desire of the Parties to reach a full and final conclusion of the Action, and to resolve the Action without the time and expense of further litigation.\" The lawsuit also argues the settlement violates the Tenth Amendment by infringing on states' rights to regulate firearms. Washington has a robust regulatory system meant to keep firearms out of the hands of dangerous individuals. That system is jeopardized by the Trump Administration's action and will be undermined by the distribution of Defense Distributed's downloadable guns. Note that Ferguson forgets that the Tenth Amendment states plainly: The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people. (emphasis mine) Since our founders clearly said that our rights come from our Creator, and the Second Amendment acknowledges that the \"right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed,\" I truly wonder where he gets this idea the state has a right to do just that, infringe on the rights of the people by regulating firearms. he is reading something into it that is simply not there, but that's a Communist ideology you are seeing there, not an American one. Reason reports on the response of Defense Distributed: Josh Blackman, one of Defense Distributed's lawyers, said in an email today that \"The District Court in Washington already approved the settlement. This latest suit is another collateral attack on a rule-making process that began in the Obama Administration.\" As reported yesterday, Defense Distributed is already embroiled in its own lawsuit against New Jersey and Los Angeles over those authorities' threats, and simultaneously is fighting Pennsylvania's request for a temporary restraining order against them. (Both those states are also part of today's federal lawsuit filed in the Western District of Washington.) While the various court filings about this continue to suggest that August 1 is the date on which Defense Distributed will begin distributing the files\u2014which, again, the settlement legally permits them to do\u2014the distribution is already happening. Cody Wilson of Defense Distributed is already fundraising off the suit via Twitter. He told me five years ago, when I was writing a feature story on the beginnings of his fight with the government over gun-making files, that \"This has been a continuous process of different levels of authority figures trying to stop it from happening and thus allowing it to happen...Of course we are going to succeed\u2014because you all are trying to stop me.

With the new uptick in those who died, the fear that the disease will spread to the United Kingdom has been confirmed as \u201c100 percent likely.\u201d The plague death toll has now shown signs that it\u2019s picking up speed again. Official figures reveal 165 people have now lost their lives in Madagascar\u2019s \u201cworst outbreak in 50 years.\u201d Recent data shows a 15 percent jump in fatalities over just three days, coupled with scientists concerned that the black death has reached a \u201ccrisis\u201d point. Ten other African countries have also been placed on high alert, warning that an outbreak could occur at any time. At least 2,034 people have been infected down by a more lethal form of the black death so far in the country, which lies off the coast of Africa, according to WHO statistics. Some experts fear the disease (which is so deadly because it is airborne) could mutate and become untreatable during this year\u2019s outbreak \u2013 which is expected to blight Madagascar until April. Others worry the plague will go beyond mainland Africa and eventually reach the US, Europe, and Britain. The plague spreads easily and can kill within 48 hours. That would leave millions more vulnerable to the outbreak, and create a short supply of life-saving antibiotics. According to the Daily Mail, experts warn the outbreak of plague in Madagascar this year is being fueled by a strain more lethal than the one which usually strikes the country. This form of the pneumonic plague is airborne, easily spread by a cough or a sneeze, and has been responsible for two-thirds of all infections this year. The bubonic form of the plague, responsible for the \u201cBlack Death\u201d in the 14th century strikes the country each year and infects around 600 people. But with over 2000 alread infected by pneumonic plague (and counting) health officials aren\u2019t willing to quit sounding alarms just yet. Paul Hunter, a professor of health protection at the world-renowned University of East Anglia, was the first expert to predict the plague could travel across the sea. He previously said: \u201cThe big anxiety is it could spread to mainland Africa, it\u2019s not probable, but certainly possible, that might then be difficult to control. If we don\u2019t carry on doing stuff here, at one point something will happen and it will get out of our control and cause huge devastation all around the world.\u201d There is always a risk with travel that the disease will spread globally, Hunter added. \u201cWe don\u2019t want a situation where the disease spreads so fast it gets out of control. We are talking about it spreading in days rather than weeks.\u201d But Hunter is adamant that a well-developed country could manage the plague should a global outbreak occur. Hopefully, most will never have to find out how well another country can manage this infection. A few health experts have warned that there is no threat to the UK, however, some have warned the plague outbreak will certainly spread to the region. Richard Conroy, the founder of Sick Holiday, has sent a chilling warning to UK authorities. Conway is saying it\u2019s \u201conly a matter of time\u201d before the disease arrives on British soil. Conroy warned it is inevitable that the plague will spread due to the vast movement of people across the globe. \u201cI believe that it\u2019s 100 percent likely that plague will arrive in the UK once more \u2013 it\u2019s just a question of \u2018when\u2019, not \u2018if\u2019. And it\u2019s not an exaggeration to say that this is a real threat \u2013 a ticking time bomb that\u2019s waiting to decimate the world,\u201d Conroy continued. \u201cWith the current outbreak still remaining treatable with antibiotics, however, the current risk is low.\u201d\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

But now we have definitive confirmation. It was Iran Bush should have invaded after 9/11 , not Iraq. Now consider this: even though, as President of the United States, Barack Obama had access to information that the general public does not have, and certainly knew of Iran\u2019s involvement in the 9/11 attacks, Obama still pursued the Iran nuclear deal and gave billions to the Islamic Republic. The Iran nuclear deal should never have proceeded \u2014 President Obama, the worst president in American history . \u201cIran Admits To Facilitating 9/11 Terror Attacks,\u201d by Adam Kredo, Washington Free Beacon, June 8, 2018: Iranian officials, in a first, have admitted to facilitating the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the U.S. by secretly aiding the free travel of al Qaeda operatives who eventually went on to fly commercial airliners into the Twin Towers in New York City, according to new remarks from a senior Iranian official. Mohammad-Javad Larijani, an international affairs assistant in the Iran\u2019s judiciary, disclosed in Farsi-language remarks broadcast on Iran\u2019s state-controlled television that Iranian intelligence officials secretly helped provide the al Qaeda attackers with passage and gave them refuge in the Islamic Republic, according to an English translation published by Al Arabiya. \u201cOur government agreed not to stamp the passports of some of them because they were on transit flights for two hours, and they were resuming their flights without having their passports stamped. However their movements were under the complete supervision of the Iranian intelligence,\u201d Larijani was quoted as saying. The remarks represent the first time senior Iranian officials have publicly admitted to aiding al Qaeda and playing a direct role in facilitating the 9/11 attacks. The U.S. government has long accused Iran of playing a role in the attacks and even fined the Islamic Republic billions as a result. The U.S. 9/11 Commission assembled to investigate the attacks concluded that Iran played a role in facilitating the al Qaeda terrorists. Larijani admitted that Iranian officials did not stamp the passports of the al Qaeda militants in order to obfuscate their movements and prevent detection by foreign governments.

It all started in the fall of 2016 when diplomats at the United States Embassy in Cuba reported some hearing loss and mild brain damage after hearing unusual and puzzling sounds. SHTFPlan originally detailed the symptoms experienced by US diplomats in Cuba back in September of 2017. Several of the affected diplomats were recent arrivals at the embassy, which reopened in 2015 as part of Barack Obama\u2019s reestablishment of diplomatic relations with Cuba. The Daily Mail reported that one diplomat described being jolted awake in a Havana hotel room by a grinding, blaring cacophony. When he moved a few feet across the room, the noise stopped. When he got back into bed, the agonizing sound hit him again; as if, he told doctors, he had walked through some invisible wall cutting straight down the middle of his room. \u2013SHTFPlan But now, the sonic attacks have progressed beyond Cuba. Other embassies have now reported the debilitating conditions of diplomats. The U.S. State Department has remained all but silent on the issue as well, other than to characterize their suspicion as unknown \u201csonic attacks\u201d targeted U.S. diplomats, according to WND. Diplomats in at least seven cities in four different countries have sought testing for strange symptoms. The victims\u2019 symptoms include \u201chearing loss, dizziness, tinnitus, balance problems, visual difficulties, headaches, fatigue, cognitive issues and sleeping problems.\u201d The latest incident occurred in conjunction with President Trump\u2019s recent visit with Kim Jong-Un. As Trump was heading to Singapore for the historic summit with North Korea\u2019s leader, a State Department diplomatic security agent who was part of the advanced team reported hearing an unusual sound he believed was similar to what was experienced by U.S. diplomats in Cuba and China who later became ill. The government employee experienced the symptoms from late 2017 until April of 2018, according to the U.S. State Department. \u201cThe employee was sent to the United States for further evaluation. On May 18, 2018, the Embassy learned that the clinical findings of this evaluation matched mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI),\u201d Jinnie Lee, U.S. Embassy spokesperson in Beijing, told Gizmodo by email. \u201cThe Chinese government has assured us they are also investigating and taking appropriate measures,\u201d Lee continued. \u2013SHTFPlan And now, some of the strange sounds have been now been recorded and released to the public.

The New York Times hypothesized that this was done, in part, to avoid the kind of conflicts such as that which Trump has proposed. Later, a special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, was appointed to carry out the investigation. Trump\u2019s lawyers, Rudolph W. Giuliani and Jay A. Sekulow, said in a telephone interview that the president was not ordering the inquiry closed but simply expressing his opinion via the social media platform. \u201cIt\u2019s not a call to action,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said, adding that it was a sentiment that Mr. Trump and his lawyers have expressed publicly before. \u201cHe\u2019s expressing his opinion, but he\u2019s not talking of his special powers he has\u201d as president, Giuliani said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t feel that he has to intervene in the process, nor is he intervening,\u201d said Sekulow. The special counsel is also looking into some of Trump\u2019s tweets about Attorney General Sessions and the former F.B.I. director James Comey and whether the messages were intended to \u201cobstruct the inquiry\u201d into his alleged Russian collusion. Senator Patrick Leahy, a Democrat of Vermont, suggested on Twitter that the president\u2019s directive to Sessions in these recent Tweets was, in fact, obstruction. When I was a prosecutor, obstruction of justice was often hard to prove, requiring difficult-to-obtain evidence that the individual\u2019s actions were truly intended to interfere with an ongoing criminal investigation.

(AP) \u2014 The Latest on 11 children found living in a filthy, makeshift compound in New Mexico (all times local): 4 p.m. A representative of a New York mosque says the raid of a ramshackle compound in New Mexico is being used as propaganda against Muslims. Ali Abdul-Karim Judan, a spokesman for the mosque, said in a video posted Thursday on Facebook that the incident was a domestic situation that has nothing to do with extremism. The grandfather of a severely disabled boy, who authorities say was kidnapped by his father and taken to the compound, has said remains found there are those of his grandson. The man is an imam at the New York mosque. Judan also cast doubt on a contention by prosecutors that children found at the site were being trained to use assault rifles in preparation for school shootings. He said authorities should not have made that claim without stronger evidence. The mosque has attracted radicals over the years, including a man who later helped bomb the World Trade Center in 1993\u2026.

A Justice Department official told the Associated Press that Mueller is not recommending any further indictments. In a letter to the heads of the Senate and House judiciary committees, Barr described Mueller\u2019s submission as a \u201cconfidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions he has reached.\u201d \u201cI am reviewing the report and anticipate that I may be in a position to advise you of the Special Counsel\u2019s principal conclusions as soon as this weekend,\u201d the letter said. Barr did not detail what the report contains, but did say that the Justice Department did not overrule any decision Mueller made. Barr said he will consult with Mueller and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who has mostly overseen the Special Counsel\u2019s Office, about \u201cwhat other information from the report\u201d can be released to Congress and the public. The White House and President Trump\u2019s lawyers said the next decisions are up to Barr. There is a possibility that Barr releases two separate reports. One would summarize Mueller\u2019s findings without including classified information and would be given to Congress\u2014and would then most likely find its way out into the public. The other would be given to a smaller group of lawmakers who head major congressional committees, such as the House and Senate intelligence committees. Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), chairman of House Intelligence, called for transparency. \u201cMueller\u2019s investigation began as a counterintelligence inquiry into whether individuals associated with the Trump campaign were compromised by a foreign power. By law, that evidence he uncovered must be shared with our Committee,\u201d he said in a tweet. \u201cAnd his report must also be made public. Now.\u201d Trump has previously said he supports the idea of making the report public. \u201cI don\u2019t mind,\u201d he has said. \u201cI mean, frankly, I told the House, \u2018If you want, let them see it.\u2019\u201d Trump has also vigorously denied any wrongdoing and has repeatedly branded the probe as a \u201ctotal witch hunt.\u201d Mueller will remain as special counsel for a period of time as he and a small contingent of staff close the office, a Justice Department spokesperson reportedly said. The handover of the report marks the end of an investigation that has for nearly two years transfixed the nation, yielded dozens of indictments and convictions, and brought down a handful of Trump\u2019s closest advisers. The Special Counsel\u2019s Office was tasked broadly with investigating any links or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump campaign, as well as any matters that arose directly from the probe. However, the scope of the investigation seems to have bled outside those lines. Several witnesses, for example, have been questioned about other countries\u2019 efforts to meddle in American politics, including Saudi Arabia, Israel, the UAE and Qatar. So far, the Special Counsel\u2019s Office has indicted or obtained guilty pleas from 34 people and three companies. Six of those are former Trump associates, and 25 of them are Russians. No Americans have been charged with conspiring with Russians to meddle in the 2016 elections\u2014at least none the public knows about. But major Trumpworld figures were charged with a variety of other crimes, including former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, deputy campaign chairman Richard Gates and Trump's former personal lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen. Cohen has been sentenced to three years in prison for crimes he committed while working for Trump, including the payments he made to two adult film star actresses for their alleged affairs with his boss. Manafort was sentenced in both Virginia and in Washington and will serve about seven years in prison. In Washington, Manafort was sentenced for for conspiring against the U.S. and a conspiracy to obstruct justice connected to his covert lobbying on behalf of Ukraine\u2019s former pro-Russian government. He was sentenced in Virginia for bank and wire fraud. The Special Counsel\u2019s Office said in a court filing last week that it had gotten all it can out of Flynn, who has been cooperating for months after pleading guilty in December 2017 to lying to the FBI about his interactions with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak. It\u2019s unclear when he will be sentenced but his lawyers want to wait until the trial for his former business partners begins in Virginia. Gates has also been cooperating on a wide variety of topics associated with the Russia investigation, including the work of Manafort. As of March, Gates was still offering the Mueller team information about his time working for Trump. He pleaded guilty in February 2018 to conspiracy and lying to the FBI. Several other law enforcement agencies have picked up pieces of Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation. The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York is actively probing the Trump inaugural committee to determine if it received illegal foreign donations and if any of that money flowed through American intermediaries. The Eastern District of New York has reportedly taken over some aspects of that probe. SDNY is also looking into the hush money payments Trump made to two former adult film actresses via Cohen. A host of other local and state law enforcement offices are working on matters related to the Trump campaign and Trump organization. Congress has also launched several of its own probes into White House security clearances, Trump\u2019s tax returns and possible obstruction of justice.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

The ex-sailor is alleging that he was subject to unequal protection of the law and cites Comey and Obama\u2019s willingness to not prosecute Hillary Clinton. Barack Obama and former FBI director James Comey let Hillary off the hook before the election, while Kristian Saucier served hard time. Saucier says that that action was \u201cunfair\u201d and \u201cunequal\u201d compared to the corruption and criminal activity of Hillary Clinton. Saucier told Fox News he was scapegoated by Obama officials who found themselves under fire for not aggressively responding to Clinton\u2019s handling of classified information through her private email servers. According to Fox News, Saucier\u2019s federal lawsuit alleges that the United States government was \u201coverzealous\u201d in prosecuting him for \u201cmishandling classified information\u201d while going easy on former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for more serious violations of the same law. Saucier\u2019s lawsuit names as defendants former President Barack Obama, former U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch, former FBI Director James Comey, former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, and Peter Strzok, the FBI agent who led the inquiry into Clinton\u2019s email account. \u201cI could have just taken the pardon by President Trump and gone on with my life,\u201d Saucier said to Fox News, adding that he feels an obligation to get to the truth of what he sees as a double standard that let Clinton get off scot-free. \u201cThe U.S. Constitution clearly states that all citizens are born with inalienable rights to be free from persecution by the government,\u201d Saucier said. \u201cMy conviction and subsequent sentence for a minor military infraction compared to the treatment of politically connected individuals is a glaring example of a violation of the rights of all Americans to have equal protection under the law.\u201d The former Navy sailor is acting as his own attorney after the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court New York barred his lawyer, Ronald Daigle, from practicing for one year. The court\u2019s move came just as Daigle was helping Saucier prepare to file the lawsuit, prompting the navy sailor to accuse New York officials of trying to hinder his court fight against Obama, Comey, and others. \u2013Fox News Saucier said that he realizes he had erred in taking the photos of the submarine, which he said he wanted to show only to his family so that they could see where he worked. He has also lashed out at Obama officials, saying that his prosecution was politically motivated, prompted by sensitivity about classified information amid the scandal involving Clinton\u2019s emails.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

Madagascar has suffered bubonic plague outbreaks almost every year since 1980, often caused by rats fleeing forest fires. The disease tends to make a comeback each hot rainy season, from September to April. On average, between 300 and 600 infections are recorded every year among a population approaching 25 million people, according to a UN estimate. But Tedros voiced alarm that \"plague in Madagascar behaved in a very, very different way this year.\" Cases sprang up far earlier than usual and, instead of being confined to the countryside, the disease infiltrated towns. The authorities recorded more than 2 000 cases, and Tedros said Wednesday the death toll stood at 207. He also pointed to the presence of the pneumonic version, which spreads more easily and is more virulent, in the latest outbreak. He praised the rapid response from WHO and Madagascar authorities that helped bring the outbreak under control, but warned that the danger was not over. The larger-than-usual outbreak had helped spread the bacteria that causes the plague more widely. This along with poor sanitation and vector control on Madagascar meant that \"when (the plague) comes again it starts from more stock, and the magnitude in the next transmission could be higher than the one that we saw,\" Tedros said. \"That means that Madagascar could be affected more, and not only that, it could even spill over into neighbouring countries and beyond,\" he warned. Complicating vector control is the fact that the fleas that carry the Yersinia pestis bacteria that causes the plague have proven to be widely resistant to chemicals and insecticides. \"That's a dangerous combination,\" Tedros said.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. Since then, there have been numerous allegations of sexual misconduct levied toward the Justice to be. Whether or not he is guilty of these allegations is left to be determined. However, it does serve as a great distraction from his actual constitution-hating and tyrannical tendencies. While Kavanaugh may be an ostensible supporter of the Second Amendment, his record indicates that he all but cannot stand the Fourth and he\u2019s not that big a fan of the First either. While the allegations against Kavanaugh should certainly be investigated \u2014 no matter how they are being spun by the left and the right \u2014 he shouldn\u2019t even be in this position based solely on his previous record.

According to this Supreme Court nominee, he thinks it is just fine and dandy for police and government to track you, spy on you, and dig through your personal life \u2014 without a warrant. On multiple occasions, Kavanaugh has been the lone voice when it comes supporting the state\u2019s rights to warrantlessly spy on its citizens. As Reason points out, in 2010 he dissented from the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision not to rehear a case in which a three-judge panel had ruled that police violated a suspected drug dealer\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights when they tracked his movements for a month by attaching a GPS device to his car without a warrant. Kavanaugh claimed that putting a GPS tracking device on a person\u2019s car without first obtaining a warrant was just fine because it didn\u2019t constitute a \u201csearch\u201d as defined by the Fourth Amendment. To Kavanaugh, bypassing the courts and tracking an individual without their consent is \u201cconstitutional.\u201d In this line of thinking, the Fourth Amendment is not violated even if police trespass on someone\u2019s physical property, or track someone\u2019s cell phone. Luckily, he was the only judge on the panel to think this. In June, the Supreme Court ruled specifically on this case noting that collecting such information actually does constitute a search and therefore requires a warrant. But it gets worse. In 2015, Kavanaugh issued a statement strongly defending the NSA\u2019s phone metadata collection program, arguing that it is \u201centirely consistent with the Fourth Amendment.\u201d To Kavanaugh, sweeping programs that collect information from innocent citizens\u2019 phones are not in conflict with having the right to be free from unlawful search and seizure. Seriously. According to Kavanaugh, the Fourth Amendment allows for searches \u201cwithout individualized suspicion\u201d when the government demonstrates a \u201cspecial need\u201d that \u201coutweighs the intrusion on individual liberty.\u201d Exactly what this \u201cspecial need\u201d is that can constitute a Gestapo like police state surveilling its own citizens is a moving target that has already been proven to be abused over and over again. \u201cThe sacrifice of our personal liberty for security is and will forever be a false choice,\u201d Senator Rand Paul said of Kavanaugh\u2019s views on the disposable nature of the constitution. Kavanaugh \u201chas no qualms about applying decades-old case law to the digital age, and he has endorsed the idea of a \u201ccounterterrorism exception\u201d to the Fourth Amendment\u2019s warrant requirement,\u201d said Liza Goitein, co-director of the Brennan Center for Justice\u2019s Liberty and National Security Program. While the left is calling for Kavanaugh to be executed over the sex abuse allegations and the right is attacking the alleged victims, others in Congress who see through the facade and media distraction are trying to draw attention to the fact that Kavanaugh is a champion of the police and surveillance state and an enemy to privacy. Representative Justin Amash does not have a vote on whether or not Kavanaugh will be appointed. However, this hasn\u2019t prevented him from becoming the only Republican to speak out against the real reasons he should not be appointed to Supreme Court. \u201cPrivacy advocates must fight,\u201d Amash tweeted. \u201cThere are many potential nominees with a conservative record on abortion, guns, and regulations. The only question is will the Senate confirm one who is really bad on the #4thAmendment, when so much is at stake in upcoming digital privacy battles.\u201d Indeed, as technology increases, so does the desire of the state to use it to spy on us. The cases headed to the supreme court in the future over what constitutes an unconstitutional search will undoubtedly be vast in number and detrimental in deciding how much freedom and privacy Americans get to keep. As for if Kavanaugh gets appointed, Amash has some harsh words to those who are blindly supporting him based on party lines: \u201cWhen Kavanaugh is on the Supreme Court, undermining our #4thAmendment right against unreasonable searches and seizures, it will be too late for others to join me.\u201d Below is a video taken at the Mises Institute of Judge Napolitano explaining the implications of this enemy of the Fourth Amendment on the Supreme Court.

They would have posed real genuine questions of Sheriff Lombardo and forced him to stumble all over himself in answering them. The words \u201cconspiracy theorists\u201d are being bandied about. Are they for real? A well-coordinated, meticulously planned attack on concertgoers leads to the murder of 58 Americans at a country music festival in Las Vegas, with over 500 injured, and they have no explanation or motive. Do the FBI and law enforcement think people won\u2019t talk about it or speculate as to what happened? Are they for real? Further, the FBI insists there is no jihad motive, while saying they don\u2019t know his motive. How can they possibly hold those two contradictory ideas at the same time? The sheriff, alluding to allegations of a conspiracy between his department, the F.B.I., and MGM \u2014 supposedly in an effort to establish a legal case \u2014 said, \u201cthere is no conspiracy.\u201d William Jacobson explains the latest \u201crevise\u201d by the authorities is the now infamously botched Vegas investigation: October 13, 2017, Legal Insurrection Police and hotel still don\u2019t agree on some details. I realize that in the heat of a shooting, particularly a mass shooting, it may take some time for a precise timeline to develop. But it didn\u2019t take very long for the Las Vegas police to release a precise timeline. The initial timeline was that Stephen Paddock\u2019s shooting stopped when, approximately 6 minutes after he started, he was interrupted by a security guard from the Mandalay Bay hotel. Paddock then turned his fire into the hallway, firing some 200 bullets, and after that the shooting stopped as police arrived. That was Version No. 1. Some days later, the Las Vegas police backed away from that timeline, and stated that the security guard actually arrived 6 minutes before Paddock started shooting into the crowd 32 stories below him. That raised a number of question, including why no one called 911 after what must have been a loud volley of shots in a hotel hallway. That was Version No. 2. But now that is disputed, in Version No. 3. WaPo reports: Las Vegas police said Friday that the gunman who opened fire on a country music festival far below his hotel suite did not shoot a security guard six minutes before that rampage, contradicting a timeline they had offered earlier this week\u2026. The confusion began Monday when police said that the gunman fired at the hotel security guard, Jesus Campos, six minutes before the mass shooting began, not during the massacre as they had said. Lombardo also said police had hunted for the source of the gunfire and that officers responding to the gunman\u2019s floor were unaware that a guard was shot until they arrived there, at which point the shooting rampage had ended. MGM Resorts pushed back on this account, first saying Tuesday that there were unspecified inaccuracies and then, on Thursday, releasing a statement directly contradicting parts of what the police had said\u2026. Lombardo had said Monday that Campos, the guard, was shot at 9:59 p.m. and that the mass shooting began at 10:05 p.m. This six-minute gap relayed by Lombardo left uncertain whether there was any lag in alerting police to the source of the gunfire during critical moments. Police said officers arrived on the 32nd floor at 10:17 p.m., two minutes after Paddock had stopped firing. MGM, though, said it was \u201cconfident\u201d that the 9:59 p.m. time was inaccurate and \u201cwas derived from a Mandalay Bay report manually created after the fact without the benefit of information we now have.\u201d The company also disputed the suggestion of a lag, saying the shooting rampage began within a minute of Campos reporting his injury on the 32nd floor. On Friday, Lombardo effectively agreed with the company\u2019s statement, though he argued that the 9:59 p.m. time he had offered four days earlier \u201cwasn\u2019t inaccurate when I provided it.\u201d Lombardo said he was told this time had been written by someone in a security log. Upon investigation, Lombardo said, police learned that Campos first encountered a barricaded door on the 32nd floor at 9:59 p.m. The guard was eventually fired upon by Paddock \u201cin close proximity to\u201d 10:05 p.m., when the mass shooting began, Lombardo continued. Clear, right? Not so fast, the police and hotel still have disagreement over important details, such as when police arrived relative to Paddock\u2019s shooting at the crowd: An enormous, important discrepancy has emerged over what happened during the Las Vegas massacre: When did police arrive on the 32nd floor where Stephen Paddock was firing his deadly fusillade onto concertgoers below? Las Vegas police say they didn\u2019t get to the floor until after the shooting was over. But MGM Resorts International, the owner of Mandalay Bay, says police officers were there shortly after the shooting began, responding to a report of a security guard being shot. The discrepancy could raise questions about whether police might have taken steps to intervene while Paddock was launching his devastating 10-minute onslaught\u2026. \u2026 on Thursday, in response to inquiries about when Mandalay Bay notified police of the Campos shooting, MGM Resorts issued a statement that was unequivocal: Las Vegas police officers accompanied Mandalay Bay security to the Campos shooting and \u201cimmediately responded.\u201d MGM said that \u201cMetro officers were together with armed Mandalay Bay security officers in the building when Campos first reported that shots were fired over the radio. These Metro officers and armed Mandalay Bay security officers immediately responded to the 32nd floor.\u201d The statement says MGM believes Paddock began firing out the window of his room within 40 seconds of Campos reporting his shooting, and Lombardo said Friday, \u201cI agree with the statement.\u201d These discrepancies on basic facts are feeding conspiracy theories. As to Paddock\u2019s motive, still nothing from the investigation. Article posted\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

Trump announced Tillerson\u2019s ouster via Twitter Tuesday, saying: \u201cMike Pompeo, Director of the CIA, will become our new Secretary of State. He will do a fantastic job! Thank you to Rex Tillerson for his service! Gina Haspel will become the new Director of the CIA, and the first woman so chosen. Congratulations to all!\u201d This is yet another big shake-up for Trump\u2019s still-young administration \u2014 and it may be the most important one to date. The move creates some big questions about both the administration\u2019s foreign policy ambitions as well as the president\u2019s relationship with the deep state. If you enjoyed Hillary Clinton\u2019s tenure as Secretary of State, you\u2019ll like Pompeo\u2019s. Like Clinton and her Democrat allies, Pompeo has long subscribed to the belief that Russia is perpetually meddling in U.S. affairs. In fact, he believes Barack Obama got Russian help too. While he was being confirmed as CIA chief, the former lawmaker lashed out at Russia for reasserting \u201d itself aggressively, invading and occupying Ukraine, threatening Europe, and doing nearly nothing to aid in the destruction and defeat of ISIS.\u201d Again, if you liked Obama-era, world-on-fire, Russians everywhere State Department shenanigans, this is your guy. Pompeo also isn\u2019t a huge fan of calling the federal government out when it is clearly violating the rights of Americans, as shown by his statements last year regarding WikiLeaks. \u201cIt is time to call out WikiLeaks for what it really is \u2013 a non-state hostile intelligence service often abetted by state actors like Russia. In January of this year, our Intelligence Community determined that Russian military intelligence \u2014 the GRU \u2014 had used WikiLeaks to release data of U.S. victims that the GRU had obtained through cyber operations against the Democratic National Committee. And the report also found that Russia\u2019s primary propaganda outlet, RT, has actively collaborated with WikiLeaks,\u201d he said. Pompeo favors increased U.S. involvement in Syria (hello, Russian proxy war), ratcheting pressure on Iran and regime change in North Korea. Clinton City\u2026 Moving on to Haspel, who will now be heading the CIA, nothing\u2019s looking any brighter. She\u2019s a big fan of torture, according to a 2013 Washington Post article pointed out this morning by The Intercept: IN MAY 2013, the Washington Post\u2019s Greg Miller reported that the head of the CIA\u2019s clandestine service was being shifted out of that position as a result of \u201ca management shake-up\u201d by then-Director John Brennan. As Miller documented, this official \u2014 whom the paper did not name because she was a covert agent at the time \u2014 was centrally involved in the worst abuses of the CIA\u2019s Bush-era torture regime. As Miller put it, she was \u201cdirectly involved in its controversial interrogation program\u201d and had an \u201cextensive role\u201d in torturing detainees. Even more troubling, she \u201chad run a secret prison in Thailand\u201d \u2014 part of the CIA\u2019s network of \u201cblack sites\u201d \u2014 \u201cwhere two detainees were subjected to waterboarding and other harsh techniques.\u201d The Senate Intelligence Committee\u2019s report on torture also detailed the central role she played in the particularly gruesome torture of detainee Abu Zubaydah. Beyond all that, she played a vital role in the destruction of interrogation videotapes that showed the torture of detainees both at the black site she ran and other secret agency locations. The concealment of those interrogation tapes, which violated multiple court orders as well as the demands of the 9/11 commission and the advice of White House lawyers, was condemned as \u201cobstruction\u201d by commission chairs Lee Hamilton and Thomas Keane. A special prosecutor and grand jury investigated those actions but ultimately chose not to prosecute. Bottom line, George W. Bush/Barack Obama era foreign policy and intelligence doctrines aren\u2019t going anywhere under Trump.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

            "question": "Which of the following tactics is used in the following text?\n\nArticle: No Justice for Kate Steinle A San Francisco jury on Thursday found Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, also known as Juan Francisco Lopez Sanchez, not guilty of the murder of Kate Steinle on a San Francisco pier on July 1, 2015. The jury of six men and six women, including three immigrants, found the Mexican national not guilty of all murder and manslaughter charges and guilty only of felony possession of a firearm. For Garcia\u2019s Zarate\u2019s attorney, Matt Gonzalez, Ralph Nader\u2019s running mate in the 2008 presidential election, the trial was all about Donald Trump. \u201cFor those who might criticize this verdict \u2013 there are a number of people who have commented on this case in the last couple of years,\u201d Gonzalez said after the verdict, \u201cthe Attorney General of the United States and the President and Vice President of the United States. Let me just remind them, they are themselves under investigation by a special prosecutor in Washington D.C. and they may soon avail themselves of the presumption of innocence beyond a reasonable doubt, so I ask that they reflect on that before they comment or disparage the results of this case.\u201d \u201cFrom day one this case was used as a means to foment hate, to foment division and to foment a program of mass deportation,\u201d added defense attorney Francisco Ugarte. \u201cIt was used to catapult a presidency along that philosophy of hate of others. I believe today is a day of vindication for the rights of immigrants.\u201d Alex Bastian of the San Francisco prosecutor\u2019s office told reporters the verdict \u201cwas not the one we were hoping for,\u201d but the Steinle family could be forgiven for any reasonable doubts about the prosecution. \u201cWe\u2019re just shocked \u2014 saddened and shocked ... that\u2019s about it,\u201d Jim Steinle, Kate\u2019s father, told the San Francisco Chronicle. \u201cThere\u2019s no other way you can coin it. Justice was rendered, but it was not served.\u201d Kate\u2019s brother Brad was \u201cstunned that they couldn\u2019t even get him on using the weapon.\u201d Attorney David Wohl told Fox News that with negligent discharge of a firearm, the defendant\u2019s action met every standard for involuntary manslaughter. The verdict, Wohl said, was \u201can utter and complete and total failure by the prosecutor.\u201d Conservative Ben Shapiro told Fox news the verdict was \u201chorrifying. . . Politics trumps evidence in California once again.\u201d For Jeff Sessions San Francisco\u2019s sanctuary city policy \u201cled to the preventable and heartbreaking death of Kate Steinle.\u201d According to the Attorney General\u2019s statement, the Justice Department \u201cwill continue to ensure that all jurisdictions place the safety and security of their communities above the convenience of criminal aliens.\u201d For his part, President Trump tweeted: \u201cA disgraceful verdict in the Kate Steinle case! No wonder the people of our Country are so angry with Illegal Immigration.\u201d Mexican national Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, 54, is a seven-time felon and has been deported five times. In 2015 federal authorities sought to detain him for deportation. San Francisco Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi chose to defy the feds and release the Mexican national. On July 1, 2015, the criminal illegal picked up a Sig Sauer .40 caliber pistol, stolen from a Bureau of Land Management officer, and fired the shot that killed Kate Steinle, only 32 years old. The Mexican nation and career criminal enjoyed all the rights of the American legal system, the presumption of innocence, and a high-profile defense attorney funded by American taxpayers. During the trial, former vice presidential candidate Matt Gonzalez claimed that Garcia Zarate\u2019s background and nationality played a role in his prosecution. As Gonzalez argued, \u201cIf this was a college student or Swedish kid would he be charged with murder?\u201d That sort of politically correct nonsense plays well in San Francisco, so any observer of the case could be forgiven for believing that prosecution and defense both got the outcome they wanted, regardless of the tragedy for the Steinle family. The felony firearms charge, the only charge on which Garcia Zarate was found guilty, carries a sentence of 16 months to 3 years. Since Garcia Zarate has been languishing in jail, the authorities could commute any sentence to time served and he could walk free within weeks. San Francisco is not likely to hand the felon over to ICE for deportation. Should that happen, Garcia Zarate has already proved five times that anybody can get away with violating U.S. immigration law. He has already proved that in the sanctuary state of California, false-documented illegals are a privileged class. Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, or whatever his real name is, has also proved that a career criminal who is not even supposed to be in the country can literally get away with murder in broad daylight. When that happens, the killer\u2019s public defender will call it a \u201cvindication for the rights of immigrants.\u201d In San Francisco, and across California, this verdict will surely give new meaning to the cry of \u201cno justice, no peace.\u201d\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

            "question": "Which of the following tactics is used in the following text?\n\nArticle: Trump Effect: Islamic Republic Ceases Naval Provocations in Arabian Gulf Yesterday\u2019s State of the Union address issued by Donald Trump represented a refreshing break from the eight years of pusillanimous foreign policies pursued by past administration. Nowhere was this more evident than in the manner in which Trump described Iran\u2019s repressive regime and attempts by the Iranian people to overthrow it through peaceful protest. When it comes to Iran\u2019s governing authorities, the Trump administration is under no illusions about the nefarious nature of this fascist theocracy. \u201cWe are restoring clarity about our adversaries,\u201d Trump stated in a not too subtle jibe at his predecessor who seemed to be in a perpetual state of confusion about who his friends and enemies were. Trump also referenced the recent widespread Iranian protests, crushed with extreme ruthlessness by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps and its Basij auxiliary militia. \u201cWhen the people of Iran rose up against the crimes of a corrupt dictatorship,\u201d he stated, \u201cI did not stay silent. America stands with the people of Iran in their courageous struggle for freedom.\u201d By contrast, Barack Obama and his obsequious acolytes were besotted by the prospect of forging d\u00e9tente with the despotic mullahs of the Islamic Republic. His administration remained largely silent when Iranians took to the streets in 2009 to protest a rigged election. Some have speculated that his administration missed out on a prime opportunity for regime change. It was only downhill from there. In a misguided effort to secure Iran\u2019s willingness to sign the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, Obama sold everything including the kitchen sink. He tried selling the American people on the na\u00efve notion that there were moderate elements of import in the Iranian government, ignoring the obvious fact that all authority in Iran is vested with the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, and his IRGC henchmen. The tried and true concept of peace through strength gave way to fecklessness through appeasement. Ransom payments to the tune of $1.7 billion were transferred to Iran. Promising criminal investigations targeting Iran\u2019s chief terror proxy, Hezbollah, were shut down. Targeted liquidation operations by our Israeli allies against Iranian Quds Force leaders were foiled after Obama tipped off Tehran on Israel\u2019s intentions. Iranian material breaches of the JCPOA were all but ignored while Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program was allowed to proceed at full speed despite being in defiance of United Nations Security Council resolution 2231. Obama\u2019s near messianic zealotry in his interactions with the mullahs severely compromised America\u2019s national security and weakened its image on the international stage. Worse, it emboldened the mullahs (appeasement tends to do that) who seemed to revel in Obama\u2019s groveling. Iran\u2019s mischief-making extends far and wide but it is in the Arabian Gulf where friction between the IRGC and the United States Navy remains constant. Iran regards the Arabian Gulf as its domain and but for the presence of the U.S. 5th Fleet, would have full reign over its waters, which include the strategic Strait of Hormuz. In addition to securing the Gulf, the 5th Fleet serves as a constant reminder to the Iranians of their impotence. But the deterrent effect of the Navy\u2019s 5th Fleet, and for that matter America\u2019s military might, is only as effective as the political leadership that commands it, and Barack Obama as Commander in Chief of the armed forces did little to instill fear or project deterrence. On the contrary, the Iranians correctly viewed him as weak, indecisive and ineffectual. On his watch, American warships patrolling the Gulf were harried by armed IRGC speed boats and larger navy frigates with near impunity. At times Iranian naval vessels closed to within 600 to 150 yards of American warships. The navy termed these near ritualistic, belligerent encounters, \u201cunsafe and unprofessional.\u201d Iranian arrogance and impudence reached its zenith with the January 12th 2016 seizure of two American riverine command boats and their crews near Farsi Island. The RCBs and crews manning them were returned some 16 hours later but not before the Iranians stole two satellite phone sim cards, likely containing classified information, as well as thousands of pages of information downloaded from laptops, GPS devices and maps used by the sailors. Ironically, the seizure occurred on the very day that Obama was to give his State of the Union address but predictably, he didn\u2019t think that the seizure of Americans was important enough to note. But according to the Navy, the past five months have witnessed markedly less belligerent conduct from the Iranians, leaving Navy officials baffled by the sudden positive change in attitude. In fact, Iran\u2019s attitude adjustment in the Arabian Gulf is no mystery and stems from the Trump administration\u2019s implementation of a new robust foreign policy vis-\u00e0-vis the Islamic Republic. Soon after taking office, Trump noted that \u201cIran [was] playing with fire\u201d and added that he wouldn\u2019t be as \u201ckind\u201d to the mullahs as Obama was. This wasn\u2019t empty rhetoric. It was backed up by tangible action. Additional sanctions were imposed against Iran for acting in defiance of UNSCR 2231. Sanctions were also imposed against the IRGC for supporting terrorism. Trump\u2019s DOJ revived and breathed new life into Project Cassandra, a promising anti-Hezbollah/IRGC law enforcement initiative shelved by Obama. Most importantly, Trump failed to certify the JCPOA noting material Iranian breaches, and has threatened to abrogate the deal in its entirety unless modifications are implemented. Those modifications would include an end to absurd sunset clauses in the JCPOA and tough restrictions on ballistic missile testing. The mullahs have become cognizant of the fact that there\u2019s a new sheriff in town, one that backs up tough talk with action and doesn\u2019t ask \u201chow high\u201d when they say \u201cjump.\u201d Clearly, the IRGC\u2019s new docile posture in the Arabian Gulf is a direct consequence of this realization.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

On Monday of this week, I predicted that Trump would make a deal with the CIA that would enable the CIA to continue its cover-up of the JFK assassination. (See \u201cI Predict Trump Will Continue the CIA\u2019s JFK Assassination Cover-Up\u201d and \u201cNo Smoking Guns in the JFK Records?\u201d) On Thursday, the day of the deadline established by law for releasing the records, Trump granted the CIA\u2019s request for continued secrecy, on grounds of \u201cnational security,\u201d more than 50 years after the Kennedy assassination. Please, don\u2019t start calling me Nostradamus. A blind man could see what was happening. Donald \u201cArt of the Deal\u201d Trump was obviously negotiating all week with the CIA, and he was obviously pushing to get what he wanted all the way up to the very last day. On Thursday, the deadline established by law for releasing the records, the CIA undoubtedly blinked and Trump presumably got what he wanted in return for granting the CIA request for continued secrecy. Time to buy old US gold coins Some mainstream media commentators are criticizing the CIA for waiting until the very last day to make its case for continued secrecy. Displaying their naivete, they demonstrate their lack of understanding about how things work in Washington, D.C. As I indicated in my Monday article, when someone in the federal government needs a favor from someone else, the someone else is going to ask for something in return. JFKu2019s War with the... Douglas Horne Check Amazon for Pricing. The fact is that the CIA put in its request to Trump for continued secrecy of its JFK records long before yesterday. But \u201cArt of the Deal\u201d Trump obviously sat on the request, undoubtedly hoping that he could get what he wanted in return if he just continued holding out and conveying that he was ready to release the records. Don\u2019t forget: According to Trump\u2019s own tweets, he had already ostensibly decided to deny the CIA\u2019s request for secrecy before the Thursday deadline: Trump tweet sent on Saturday, October 21: \u201cSubject to the receipt of further information, I will be allowing, as President, the long blocked and classified JFK FILES to be opened.\u201d Trump tweet sent on Wednesday, October 25: \u201cThe long anticipated release of the #JFKFiles will take place tomorrow. So interesting! Now, it\u2019s theoretically possible that the CIA presented Trump with some earthshattering new information on the Thursday deadline that showed that the United States would fall into the ocean if Americans were finally permitted to see the CIA\u2019s long-secret JFK records. But how likely is that? Not likely at all! Instead, it is a virtual certainly that when Art of the Deal Trump sent out those two tweets, he was sending a message to the CIA as part of the negotiations: Give me what I want or I will release the records. In the negotiations, both Trump and the CIA knew that Trump was in the catbird seat. The Kennedy Autopsy Jacob Hornberger Check Amazon for Pricing. In the end, the CIA blinked, just as Trump knew it would. Contrary to what the mainstream press is asserting, the records undoubtedly contain more incriminating circumstantial evidence that fills in the mosaic of a U.S. national-security regime-change operation on November 22, 1963. That\u2019s what the mainstream media, forever wedded to the official story no matter how ridiculous and illogical it is, simply cannot bring themselves to confront. Trump knew that he had the CIA over a barrel. As I indicated in my two articles this week, the CIA was between a rock and a hard place. On the one hand, it could refuse to grant Trump what he wanted and let the records be released, which it knew would point to the CIA\u2019s guilt in the assassination. On the other hand, it could give Trump what he wanted and have to suffer the obvious inference that people would draw \u2014 that the CIA was continuing to cover up incriminatory evidence. What did the CIA give Trump in return for Trump\u2019s extending the CIA\u2019s 50-year-plus secrecy? We don\u2019t know, but my hunch is that it pertains to Russia. Here\u2019s my next prediction: the congressional investigations into Trump\u2019s supposed \u201ccollusion\u201d with Russia are about to fizzle out. That\u2019s because I believe that the CIA, as part of its deal with Trump, will order its assets in Congress to cease and desist with respect to that investigation. In my opinion, that\u2019s the price the CIA had to pay in return for its continued cover-up of its U.S. regime-change operation in November 1963. Notice something else about the deal that Trump has presumably made with the CIA: The secrecy arrangement extends only to April. Ostensibly, the next six months are needed to carefully review the records to determine whether the records really to relate to \u201cnational security.\u201d Regime Change: The JFK... Jacob Hornberger Check Amazon for Pricing. Not surprisingly, the mainstream media isn\u2019t even questioning that ludicrous notion. For more than 50 years, the CIA has known why it has wanted those particular records to be kept secret. During the term of the Assassination Records Review Board in the 1990s, the CIA decided to keep these particular records secret for another 25 years. There are bound to be lots of CIA memoranda detailing why it was imperative to keep these particular records secret for as long as possible. Finally, the CIA made its request for secrecy to Trump at least several weeks ago. The notion that the CIA suddenly hit Trump yesterday with a new argument as to why \u201cnational security\u201d would be threatened, after Trump had supposedly already rejected the arguments that had been presented to him, causing Trump to suddenly change his mind, is, well, laughable.

Alright? This is a f***ed up ass state. It\u2019s a cracker state,\u201d Smith says, explaining that a progressive agenda cannot pass and using a racial slur against white voters. He points to specific campaign promises Gillum has made, including raising the corporate tax in Florida, raising teacher pay, and Medicare for All, admitting they are lies. So, let\u2019s go back to Mr. Gillum\u2019s platform, right? Raise the corporate tax in Florida from 7 to 11 percent. That will never happen. Raise teachers\u2019 pay to $50,000; that will never happen. Give me another position. Medicare for all; that will never happen. The reason being, the legislature that write the bills is all Republican-controlled. Democratic governor, Republican legislature. So, unless the legislature writes a bill, and it got voted on the floor, it cannot pass. The full video shows Smith saying that the strategy to change the Florida legislature is to take \u201cpoor\u201d and \u201cmiddle income\u201d people and \u201cwhip them up into a frenzy in order for them to vote.\u201d He adds that \u201cyou have to appeal to white guilt.\u201d Smith defines Gillum\u2019s political beliefs as \u201cpart of the crazy crazy crazies\u201d on the progressive Left. More damaging footage includes Democratic operatives explaining Gillum\u2019s positions on gun control and indicating he would support banning AR-15 rifles. Florida Democrat Party community engagement specialist Adrian Young also admits on video that Gillum is not campaigning with that position because it would be unpopular with Florida voters. \u201cI do think he\u2019s not saying specifically like I\u2019m going to ban bump stocks or I\u2019m against ARs, only because he\u2019s running a race right now.

The video evidence confirms that Gillum is lying to Florida voters. Will there be wall-to-wall coverage in the media eviscerating Gilllum for making promises he can\u2019t keep?

Inspector General Michael Horowitz\u2019 report on the FBI\u2019s handling of the Clinton email investigation has finally been released to the public and while it does indeed lambaste former FBI Director James Comey for his terrible judgment and handling of the Clinton investigation, it stops short of blaming it all on politics. Horowitz\u2019 report not only slams Comey, but it also criticizes former Attorney General Loretta Lynch, and immoral FBI philanderers Peter Strzok and Lisa Page. Horowitz blames Comey, Strzok, and Page for besmirching the good name of the FBI and harming the agencies reputation with the American people. take our poll - story continues below Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?

At the end of the day, Horowitz was unable to find solid proof that the agency acted in a politically partisan and biased manner in the Clinton email case. However, the Inspector General left the door open to the possibility that political bias did indeed play a role, as his current investigation in the Russia-Collusion probe of the FBI and the DOJ could reveal new evidence to damn the FBI\u2019s Obama era leadership. While the report refuses to say conclusively that political bias was the animus behind the FBI\u2019s handling of the Clinton probe, it also indicates that IG Horowitz may have more to say about the FBI\u2019s political leanings in his Russia report. The Washington Post explains: The Justice Department inspector general on Thursday castigated former FBI Director James B. Comey for his actions during the Hillary Clinton email investigation and found that other senior bureau officials showed a \u201cwillingness to take official action\u201d to prevent Donald Trump from becoming president\u2026 Some senior bureau officials, the report found, exhibited a disturbing \u201cwillingness to take official action\u201d to hurt Trump\u2019s chances to become president. Perhaps the most damaging new revelation in the report is a previously-unreported text message in which Peter Strzok, a key investigator on both the Clinton email case and the investigation of Russia and the Trump campaign, assured an FBI lawyer in August 2016 that \u201cwe\u2019ll stop\u201d Trump from making it to the White House. \u201c[Trump\u2019s] not ever going to become president, right? Right?!\u201d the lawyer, Lisa Page, wrote to Strzok. \u201cNo. No he won\u2019t. We\u2019ll stop it,\u201d Strzok responded\u2026 The inspector general concluded that Strzok\u2019s text, along with others disparaging Trump, \u201cis not only indicative of a biased state of mind but, even more seriously, implies a willingness to take official action to impact the presidential candidate\u2019s electoral prospects.\u201d The messages \u201cpotentially indicated or created the appearance that investigative decisions were impacted by bias or improper considerations,\u201d the inspector general wrote\u2026 Strzok has argued that he was just trying to reassure Page that Trump couldn\u2019t win, and that he wasn\u2019t implying that they would take action to stop his election. But it wasn\u2019t just Page and Strzok, there were FIVE other investigators on the Clinton case who expressed overtly political views in support of Clinton and/or against Trump\u2026 DURING the investigation. Page and Strzok are not the only FBI officials assigned to the Clinton email probe who were found to have exchanged personal messages indicating either an animus against Trump or frustration with the fact that the FBI was investigating Clinton. The report identified five officials with some connection to the email probe who were expressing political views, faulting them for having brought \u201cdiscredit to themselves, sowed doubt about the FBI\u2019s handling of the midyear investigation, and impacted the reputation of the FBI.\u201d The midyear investigation refers to the Clinton email probe. \u201cThe messages cast a cloud over the FBI investigations to which these employees were assigned,\u201d Horowitz alleged. \u201cUltimately the consequences of these actions impact not only the senders of these messages but also other who worked on these investigation and, indeed, the entire FBI.\u201d The IG also found that the FBI moved slowly on new evidence that could have damned Hillary Clinton, and did so for reasons that make no sense. The report took particular aim at FBI officials investigating Clinton\u2019s email server for moving slowly after agents in the New York Field office discovered messages on the laptop of disgraced former Congressman Anthony Weiner that might be relevant to their case. By no later than September 29, the inspector general alleged, the bureau had learned \u201cvirtually every fact\u201d it would cite as justification late the next month to search Weiner\u2019s laptop for messages of Clinton and top aide Huma Abedin. The inspector general derided the bureau\u2019s reasons for not moving more quickly \u2014 that agents were waiting for additional information from New York, that they couldn\u2019t move without a warrant and that investigators were more focused on the Russia case \u2014 as \u201cunpersuasive,\u201d \u201cillogical,\u201d and inconsistent with their assertion that they would leave no stone unturned on Clinton. The report also faulted the bureau for assigning essentially the same personnel to the Russia and Clinton teams, and singled out Strzok, suggesting his anti-Trump views might have played a role in his not acting more expeditiously on the new lead. \u201cUnder these circumstances, we did not have confidence that Strzok\u2019s decision to prioritize the Russia investigation over following up on the Midyear-related investigative lead discovered on the Weiner laptop was free from bias,\u201d the report said. Did you get that? IG Horowitz can\u2019t prove it, but he\u2019s not sure\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

Jean Jack Muyembe, head of the national institute for biological research, said that at least ten more cases were also suspected in the northwestern town of Bikoro. Local health officials in Democratic Republic of Congo reported 21 patients showing signs of hemorrhagic fever and 17 deaths in the affected area before an Ebola outbreak was confirmed on Tuesday, the health ministry said. Medical teams have taken five samples from suspected active cases and two tested positive for the Zaire strain of the Ebola virus, the ministry said in a statement. It is the ninth time Ebola has been recorded in the DRC. Last year, eight people were infected and four people died after an outbreak of the disease. Ebola virus disease, formerly known as Ebola haemorrhagic fever, is a severe, often fatal illness in humans. The virus is transmitted to people from wild animals and spreads in the human population through human-to-human transmission. It is believed to be spread over long distances by bats, which can host the virus without dying. These animals then infect other tree-dwelling creatures such as monkeys. Ebola can often spread to humans from infected bushmeat. Image: Ebola is a difficult illness to contain and efforts to stop it spreading are vital The World Health Organisation reports that the first Ebola outbreaks occurred in remote villages in Central Africa, near tropical rainforests. The two-year outbreak in West Africa that began in 2014 involved major urban areas as well as rural ones. More than 11,300 people died and some 28,600 were infected, most of them in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. Sporadic cases of Ebola have occurred since the epidemic was brought under control, with a small number of patients being confirmed in 2017. The disease was first detected in 1976 in two simultaneous outbreaks, one in what is now Nzara, South Sudan, and the other in Yambuku in the DRC. The latter occurred near the River Ebola, after which the disease is named.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

As a result of the news, President Donald Trump has threatened to send the military to the border to block them. Reuters reports on the caravan. More Honduran migrants tried to join a caravan of several thousand trekking through Guatemala on Wednesday, defying calls by authorities not to make the journey after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to cut off regional aid in reprisal. The caravan has been growing steadily since it left the violent Honduran city of San Pedro Sula on Saturday. The migrants hope to reach Mexico and then cross its northern border with the United States, to seek refuge from endemic violence and poverty in Central America. Several thousand people are now part of the caravan, according to a Reuters witness traveling with the group in Guatemala, where men women and children on foot and riding in trucks filled a road on their long journey to Mexico. In a series of tweets on Thursday, President Trump said the right things.

The obvious question I have is: Why are you not stopping those payments now, Mr. President? They are unconstitutional and neither Congress nor you have the authority to give American's money to these countries. Trump also seemed ready to back out on his new trade deal, which is hardly a deal for the US, with Mexico if they failed to stop the caravan. He then pointed out that many who cross the border are criminals and are coming to engage in criminal activity. In fact, every single migrant who crosses over into our country will more than likely commit at least 28 crimes in order to present themselves as legal. \u201cThe assault on our country at our Southern Border, including the Criminal elements and DRUGS pouring in, is far more important to me, as President, than Trade or the USMCA,\u201d he wrote.

Schaaf tweeted out a warning ahead of the raid in northern California last month, infuriating Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials and the Trump administration. \u201cHow dare you!\u201d Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in California this month, addressing Schaaf. \u201cHow dare you needlessly endanger the lives of our law enforcement officers to promote a radical, open borders agenda.\u201d ICE officials eventually caught 232 illegal immigrants, many of them criminals, in the four-day sweep but said that hundreds more escaped because of Schaaf\u2019s warning. But on Tuesday, officials said that at least three of those who were targeted in the raid, but were not apprehended, had since been arrested for additional crimes. One was a Mexican national arrested for robbery and gun crimes, who was released back into the community for a prior offense despite an ICE detainer request in November. Another Mexican national was arrested for a DUI, despite having been deported three times and prior convictions for false imprisonment, DUI and battery of a spouse. The third was a Mexican national who was arrested for corporal injury of a spouse, despite being deported twice and criminal convictions including drug possession, hit-and-run, DUIs, possessions of narcotics equipment and a parole violation.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

In Newly Obtained Memo, Congress\u2019 Top Cop Said House Democratic Caucus Server VANISHED https://t.co/gTj2UgSZJr via @dailycaller \u2014 Luke Rosiak (@lukerosiak) July 2, 2018 A secret memo marked \u201cURGENT\u201d detailed how the House Democratic Caucus\u2019s server went \u201cmissing\u201d soon after it became evidence in a cybersecurity probe. The secret memo also said more than \u201c40 House offices may have been victims of IT security violations.\u201d In the memo, Congress\u2019s top law enforcement official, Sergeant-at-Arms Paul Irving, along with Chief Administrative Officer Phil Kiko, wrote, \u201cWe have concluded that the employees [Democratic systems administrator Imran Awan and his family] are an ongoing and serious risk to the House of Representatives, possibly threatening the integrity of our information systems and thereby members\u2019 capacity to serve constituents.\u201d The memo, addressed to the Committee on House Administration (CHA) and dated Feb. 3, 2017, was recently reviewed and transcribed by The Daily Caller News Foundation. The letter bolsters TheDCNF\u2019s previous reporting about the missing server and evidence of fraud on Capitol Hill. It details how the caucus server, run by then-caucus Chairman Rep. Xavier Becerra, was secretly copied by authorities after the House Inspector General (IG) identified suspicious activity on it, but the Awans\u2019 physical access was not blocked. But after, the report reads, the server appears to have been secretly replaced with one that looked similar. The memo called for firing the Pakistani-born aides, revoking all their computer accounts, and changing the locks on any door they had access to. Rep. Louie Gohmert \u2014 a Texas Republican on the House Committee on the Judiciary who has done oversight work on the case \u2014 said the missing server contained copies of Congress members\u2019 emails. \u201cThey put 40 members of Congress\u2019s data on one server \u2026 That server, with that serial number, has disappeared,\u201d he said. Multiple sources connected to the investigation told TheDCNF that shortly after an IG report came out identifying the House Democratic Caucus server as key evidence in a criminal probe, the evidence was stolen. \u201cThey [the Awans] deliberately turned over a fake server\u201d to falsify evidence, one official close to the CHA alleged. \u201cIt was a breach. The data was completely out of [members\u2019] possession.\u201d The six-page letter says: \u2022 In September of 2016 \u2026 the CHA and [IG] briefed the former Chairman of the Democratic Caucus about suspicious activity related to their server that the [IG] identified. As a result, the former Chairman of the Democratic Caucus directed the CAO to copy the data from their server and two computers. \u2022 The CHA directed the IG to refer the matter to the US Capitol Police. The USCP initiated an investigation that continues to this day. \u2022 In late 2016, the former Chairman of the Democratic Caucus announced his intention to resign from Congress to assume a new position. The CAO and [sergeant-at-arms] worked with the Chairman to account for his inventory, including the one server. \u2022 While reviewing the inventory, the CAO discovered that the serial number of the server did not match that of the one imaged in September. [Investigators] also discovered that the server in question [the replacement server] was still operating under the employee\u2019s control, contrary to the explicit instructions of the former chairman to turn over all equipment and fully cooperate with the inquiry and investigation. [A House source said the \"employee\u201d was Abid Awan.] \u2022 The USCP interviewed relevant staff regarding the missing server. \u2022 On January 24, 2017, the CAO acquired the [r[replacement]erver from the control of the employees and transferred that server to the USCP. President Donald Trump referenced the Democratic Caucus\u2019 missing server in a tweet. But because the letter to the CHA was kept secret, many news outlets have not grasped that the House\u2019s top cop documented a \u201cmissing server\u201d connected to the Democratic Caucus. The timeline laid out in the letter also shows that Becerra \u2014 now California\u2019s Democratic attorney general \u2014 failed to ensure that the Awans didn\u2019t have access to House computer systems during the 2016 election, which was wrought with cybersecurity scandals. An IG presentation from September 2016 shows that Becerra knew of problems months before the server disappeared. \u201cThe Caucus Chief of Staff requested one of the shared employees to not provide IT services or access their computers,\u201d it read. \u201cThis shared employee continued.\u201d It\u2019s unclear why that request was not granted or why it was a request rather than an order. A House official close to the probe said the employee was Abid, who was not on Becerra or the Caucus\u2019s payroll. The official said Becerra Chief of Staff Sean McCluskie apparently knew Abid was accessing Caucus servers. According to payroll records, Abid\u2019s sister-in-law, Hina Alvi, was the Caucus\u2019 systems administrator. The Awans\u2019 continued physical access to Becerra\u2019s\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

The Muslim Brotherhood's leaders praising Hitler, calling for another Holocaust and killing Jews is nothing like the Holocaust. And only shameless Zionists would attempt to equate killing Jews with killing Jews. 2. Anything a Republican president does is exactly like the Holocaust. A former CIA director compared US immigration policy to Nazi Germany in an ominous Tweet. \u201cOther governments have separated mothers and children,\u201d Former CIA and NSA chief Michael Hayden wrote on Saturday, along with a black and white photo of the Birkenau concentration and death-camp in Poland. Then Hayden doubled down on that analogy. It's particularly stupid of Michael Hayden to make that analogy because during the Bush years, the agencies he ran were compared to Nazi Germany. Repeatedly. You might think that would have cured him of facile Nazi analogies. But instead it seems to have whetted his appetite for making them. Yes, the Nazi arrested people, asked them for ID, split up families and... then killed them all. That's the really relevant part. Every country arrests people. Just about every country splits up families when they arrest the parents. That's not unique. Selecting the Jews, based on race, for extermination is more of the reason why the term Nazi is not a positive one. Hayden's thoughtless tweet can just as easily be used to delegitimize any and all law enforcement. The attacks here are motivated by a desire for open borders.

In Greenwald\u2019s mind, Trump is a fairly standard politician (when it comes to the policies he supports and implements), which is what makes the media\u2019s constant flow of outrage so mystifying. In a recent debate over the Helsinki Hulabaloo, Greenwald told the leftists at Democracy Now! that getting all worked up over Trump\u2019s press conference with Putin was ridiculous. Why? Because, when Trump\u2019s Russia policies are measured against Obama\u2019s\u2026 it becomes CLEAR that Trump has obviously been tougher against Russia than Obama ever was. take our poll - story continues below Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?

You also agree to this site's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use. Here\u2019s the crux of Greenwald\u2019s argument: So let me just make two points. Number one is, if you look at President Obama versus President Trump, there\u2019s no question that President Obama was more cooperative with and collaborative with Russia and the Russian agenda than President Trump. President Trump has sent lethal arms to Ukraine\u2014a crucial issue for Putin\u2014which President Obama refused to do. President Trump has bombed the Assad forces in Syria, a client state of Putin, something that Obama refused to do because he didn\u2019t want to provoke Putin. Trump has expelled more Russian diplomats and sanctioned more Russian oligarchs than [Obama] has. Trump undid the Iran deal, which Russia favored, while Obama worked with Russia in order to do the Iran deal. So this idea that Trump is some kind of a puppet of Putin, that he controls him with blackmail, is the kind of stuff that you believe if you read too many Tom Clancy novels but isn\u2019t borne out by the facts. The other issue that I want to make is that, you know, again, this idea that somehow that you are endorsing the repression of other countries\u2019 leaders if you meet with them\u2014it is true that Trump has never criticized Putin, although he has taken all the steps I just outlined against Putin. But he\u2019s also never criticized Benjamin Netanyahu. He\u2019s also never criticized the incredibly repressive leaders of Saudi Arabia. He\u2019s never criticized the fascist president of the Philippines. It is true President Trump likes fascist and authoritarian leaders, and that is a problem, but it\u2019s not like Putin is the only leader that he doesn\u2019t criticize.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 13, 2018 The Washington Post first reported on the story prior to Trump\u2019s tweet. Trump and Tillerson have had a fraught relationship for many months. Trump told reporters Tuesday that he ultimately decided to fire the secretary because they disagreed over strategy in key areas of foreign policy, such as the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, the approach to North Korea and the overall tone of U.S. diplomacy. Tillerson said he received a call from Trump around noon Tuesday, more than three hours after his firing was first reported by The Washington Post and announced minutes later in a tweet from the president. His voice quivering, Tillerson thanked career diplomats for their \u201chonesty and integrity\u201d and the American people for \u201cacts of kindness,\u201d and he singled out Defense Secretary Jim Mattis for their partnership and mutual support of diplomacy. But he notably did not thank Trump or praise his policies. Tillerson said he will remain in his post until March 31 but is delegating all authorities for running the State Department to Deputy Secretary John Sullivan and is committed to ensuring \u201can orderly and smooth transition.\u201d The deposed diplomat also made a clear statement about Russian aggression: \u201cMuch work remains to respond to the troubling behavior and actions on the part of the Russian government.\u201d CNBC reports that Tillerson was not the only firing that took place on Tuesday: On Tuesday morning, State Department spokesman Steve Goldstein said Tillerson had no plans to leave. He \u201cdid not speak to the president this morning and is unaware of the reason\u201d for his firing, the spokesman added. Two White House officials told the Associated Press that Tillerson found out he was fired Friday. The secretary got a call from White House chief of staff John Kelly but only got told an unspecified presidential tweet concerning him may be coming, officials at the State Department told the wire service. Later, the White House fired Goldstein, who contradicted the administration\u2019s account of Tillerson\u2019s ouster, according to NBC News and the AP. Goldstein was the under secretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs. Trump later told reporters he disagreed with Tillerson on some issues and feels the diplomat \u201cwill be much happier now.\u201d While many are happy that Tillerson is gone, many of us are concerned with Mike Pompeo being installed at Secretary of State, especially regarding his un-American comments against NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, who exposed the criminal activity of the Deep State in DC. Speaking of Snowden, he decided to chime in on the newly appointed CIA director, but did not say anything about Pompeo becoming Secretary of State. \u201cThe new CIA director was a key part of the torture program and its illegal cover-up. Her name was on the Top Secret order demanding the destruction of tapes to prevent them being seen by Congress. Incredible.\u201d Snowden tweeted.

During this operation, ERO deportation officers made arrests in the following Illinois cities and towns: Chicago (9), Cicero (4), Hoffman Estates (1), Palatine (4), Park City (1), Rolling Meadows (2) and Round Lake Beach (1). All those arrested were men between the ages of 20 and 53. Aliens arrested during this operation are from the following five countries: Ecuador (1), Honduras (2), Mexico (17), Serbia (1) and Ukraine (1). Six of the 22 arrested during this operation were criminal aliens who were released back into their communities after local law enforcement failed to honor an immigration detainer placed on the individuals by ICE. Immigration detainers request that ICE be notified before the individual is released from local custody for any reason. Most of the aliens targeted by ERO deportation officers during this operation had prior criminal histories that included convictions for the following crimes: sexual assault, kidnapping, assault, assault with a weapon, drug possession, theft, obstruction of justice and driving under the influence (DUI); two were known fugitive immigration violators, and six were arrested for illegally re-entering the United States after having been deported, which is a felony. The following are criminal summaries of the offenders arrested in Illinois during this operation: A 38-year-old Mexican citizen and a known gang member was arrested Jan. 8 in Rolling Meadows. He was previously convicted in Cook County for felony aggravated criminal sexual assault and bodily harm. He was previously deported. Cook County Sheriff\u2019s Office did not honor the ICE detainer that was placed. He remains in ICE custody pending presentation of criminal prosecution for re-entry after deportation. A 37-year-old previously deported Mexican man was arrested Jan. 7 in Chicago. He was previously convicted twice of drug possession, and he has pending criminal charges for sexually assaulting a child. He remains in ICE custody pending presentation of criminal prosecution for re-entry after deportation. A 20-year-old Mexican man and a known gang member was arrested Jan. 7 in Round Lake Beach. He was previously convicted of battery. He is also Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipient with two extensions. He was served a notice to appear before a federal immigration judge, and will remain in ICE custody pending disposition of his immigration proceedings. A 32-year-old previously deported Ecuadoran man was arrested Jan. 7 in Chicago. He has criminal convictions for DUI, domestic assault and assault. He remains in ICE custody pending presentation of criminal prosecution for re-entry after deportation. A 46-year-old previously deported Mexican man was arrested Jan. 7 in Chicago. He has a criminal conviction for possessing cocaine. He remains in ICE custody pending presentation of criminal prosecution for re-entry after deportation. Depending on an alien\u2019s criminality, an alien who re-enters the United States after having been previously deported commits a felony punishable by up to 20 years in federal prison, if convicted. \u201cOur dedicated officers strive to make our communities safer by arresting convicted criminal aliens and removing them from the United States despite the reckless sanctuary policies that are currently in place in Cook County that put our communities at risk,\u201d said Ricardo Wong, field office director of ERO Chicago. \u201cThis operation focused on targeting immigration fugitives and criminal aliens in two Illinois counties, but we routinely conduct operations daily. By removing criminal aliens from the streets, our ICE officers provide an invaluable community service by improving public safety.\u201d All of the targets in this operation were amenable to arrest and removal under the U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act.

He did not specify how many had turned back. Still, the caravan had grown to about 4,000 people today. NBC News reported that many of those in the caravan are unaccompanied children.

Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigan\u00f2's 11-page statement, released to the National Catholic Register, accuses Pope Francis of covering for McCarrick, ignoring the sanctions that Pope Benedict had imposed on McCarrick, and also of making McCarrick a trusted counselor who became Francis's \"kingmaker\" when it came to American appointments and was highly instrumental in the Pope's decision to elevate far-Left bishops such as Blase Cupich of Chicago and Joseph Tobin of Newark to the College of Cardinals. Remnant Editor's Note: This could well mark the beginning of the end of the disastrous pontificate of Pope Francis. The former apostolic nuncio to the United States has accused Francis of repealing sanctions imposed by Pope Benedict XVI on then-Cardinal McCarrick for sexual abuse. This is a charge most serious, perhaps without precedent in modern times. Bishops and priests, abusing their authority, have committed horrendous crimes to the detriment of their faithful, minors, innocent victims, and young men eager to offer their lives to the Church, or by their silence have not prevented that such crimes continue to be perpetrated. To restore the beauty of holiness to the face of the Bride of Christ, which is terribly disfigured by so many abominable crimes, and if we truly want to free the Church from the fetid swamp into which she has fallen, we must have the courage to tear down the culture of secrecy and publicly confess the truths we have kept hidden. We must tear down the conspiracy of silence with which bishops and priests have protected themselves at the expense of their faithful, a conspiracy of silence that in the eyes of the world risks making the Church look like a sect, a conspiracy of silence not so dissimilar from the one that prevails in the mafia. \u201cWhatever you have said in the dark ... shall be proclaimed from the housetops\u201d (Lk. 12:3). I had always believed and hoped that the hierarchy of the Church could find within itself the spiritual resources and strength to tell the whole truth, to amend and to renew itself. That is why, even though I had repeatedly been asked to do so, I always avoided making statements to the media, even when it would have been my right to do so, in order to defend myself against the calumnies published about me, even by high-ranking prelates of the Roman Curia. But now that the corruption has reached the very top of the Church\u2019s hierarchy, my conscience dictates that I reveal those truths regarding the heart-breaking case of the Archbishop Emeritus of Washington, D.C., Theodore McCarrick, which I came to know in the course of the duties entrusted to me by St. John Paul II, as Delegate for Pontifical Representations, from 1998 to 2009, and by Pope Benedict XVI, as Apostolic Nuncio to the United States of America, from October 19, 2011 until end of May 2016. As Delegate for Pontifical Representations in the Secretariat of State, my responsibilities were not limited to the Apostolic Nunciatures, but also included the staff of the Roman Curia (hires, promotions, informational processes on candidates to the episcopate, etc.) and the examination of delicate cases, including those regarding cardinals and bishops, that were entrusted to the Delegate by the Cardinal Secretary of State or by the Substitute of the Secretariat of State. To dispel suspicions insinuated in several recent articles, I will immediately say that the Apostolic Nuncios in the United States, Gabriel Montalvo and Pietro Sambi, both prematurely deceased, did not fail to inform the Holy See immediately, as soon as they learned of Archbishop McCarrick\u2019s gravely immoral behavior with seminarians and priests. Indeed, according to what Nuncio Pietro Sambi wrote, Father Boniface Ramsey, O.P.\u2019s letter, dated November 22, 2000, was written at the request of the late Nuncio Montalvo. In the letter, Father Ramsey, who had been a professor at the diocesan seminary in Newark from the end of the \u201980s until 1996, affirms that there was a recurring rumor in the seminary that the Archbishop \u201cshared his bed with seminarians,\u201d inviting five at a time to spend the weekend with him at his beach house. And he added that he knew a certain number of seminarians, some of whom were later ordained priests for the Archdiocese of Newark, who had been invited to this beach house and had shared a bed with the Archbishop.

The Australian government and prime minister Malcolm Turnbull have an historic opportunity to decide which it will be. They can remain silent, for which history will be unforgiving. Or they can act in the interests of justice and humanity and bring this remarkable Australian citizen home. Assange does not ask for special treatment. The government has clear diplomatic and moral obligations to protect Australian citizens abroad from gross injustice: in Julian\u2019s case, from a gross miscarriage of justice and the extreme danger that await him should he walk out of the Ecuadorean embassy in London unprotected. We know from the Chelsea Manning case what he can expect if a U.S. extradition warrant is successful \u2014 a United Nations Special Rapporteur called it torture. I know Julian Assange well; I regard him as a close friend, a person of extraordinary resilience and courage. I have watched a tsunami of lies and smear engulf him, endlessly, vindictively, perfidiously; and I know why they smear him. In 2008, a plan to destroy both WikiLeaks and Assange was laid out in a top secret document dated 8 March, 2008. The authors were the Cyber Counter-intelligence Assessments Branch of the U.S. Defence Department. They described in detail how important it was to destroy the \u201cfeeling of trust\u201d that is WikiLeaks\u2019 \u201ccentre of gravity\u201d. Against the State: An ... Llewellyn H. Rockwell Jr. Best Price: $9.95 Buy New $9.95 (as of 06:00 EDT - Details) This would be achieved, they wrote, with threats of \u201cexposure [and] criminal prosecution\u201d and a unrelenting assault on reputation. The aim was to silence and criminalise WikiLeaks and its editor and publisher. It was as if they planned a war on a single human being and on the very principle of freedom of speech. Vichy Media Their main weapon would be personal smear. Their shock troops would be enlisted in the media \u2014 those who are meant to keep the record straight and tell us the truth. The irony is that no one told these journalists what to do. I call them Vichy journalists \u2014 after the Vichy government that served and enabled the German occupation of wartime France. Last October, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation journalist Sarah Ferguson interviewed Hillary Clinton, over whom she fawned as \u201cthe icon for your generation\u201d. This was the same Clinton who threatened to \u201cobliterate totally\u201d Iran and, who, as U.S. secretary of State in 2011, was one of the instigators of the invasion and destruction of Libya as a modern state, with the loss of 40,000 lives. Like the invasion of Iraq, it was based on lies. When the Libyan President was murdered publicly and gruesomely with a knife, Clinton was filmed whooping and cheering. Thanks largely to her, Libya became a breeding ground for ISIS and other jihadists. Thanks largely to her, tens of thousands of refugees fled in peril across the Mediterranean, and many drowned. WikiLeaks Exposed Clinton Leaked emails published by WikiLeaks revealed that Hillary Clinton\u2019s foundation \u2013 which she shares with her husband \u2013 received millions of dollars from Saudi Arabia and Qatar, the main backers of ISIS and terrorism across the Middle East. As Secretary of State, Clinton approved the biggest arms sale ever \u2014 worth $80 billion \u2014 to Saudi Arabia, one of her foundation\u2019s principal benefactors. Today, Saudi Arabia is using these weapons to crush starving and stricken people in a genocidal assault on Yemen. Sarah Ferguson, a highly paid reporter, raised not a word of this with Hillary Clinton sitting in front of her. Instead, she invited Clinton to describe the \u201cdamage\u201d Julian Assange did \u201cpersonally to you\u201d. In response, Clinton defamed Assange, an Australian citizen, as \u201cvery clearly a tool of Russian intelligence\u201d and \u201ca nihilistic opportunist who does the bidding of a dictator\u201d. She offered no evidence \u2014 nor was asked for any \u2014 to back her grave allegations. At no time was Assange offered the right of reply to this shocking interview, which Australia\u2019s publicly-funded state broadcaster had a duty to give him. As if that wasn\u2019t enough, Ferguson\u2019s executive producer, Sally Neighour, followed the interview with a vicious re-tweet: \u201cAssange is Putin\u2019s bitch. We all know it!\u201d There are many other examples of Vichy journalism. The Guardian, reputedly once a great liberal newspaper, conducted a vendetta against Julian Assange. Like a spurned lover, the Guardian aimed its personal, petty, inhuman and craven attacks at a man whose work it once published and profited from. The WikiLeaks Files: T... WikiLeaks Best Price: $2.50 Buy New $7.00 (as of 05:50 EDT - Details) The former editor of the Guardian, Alan Rusbridger, called the WikiLeaks disclosures, which his newspaper published in 2010, \u201cone of the greatest journalistic scoops of the last 30 years\u201d. Awards were lavished and celebrated as if Julian Assange did not exist. Maligning and Profiting off Assange WikiLeaks\u2019 revelations became part of the Guardian\u2019s marketing plan to raise the paper\u2019s cover price. They made money, often big money, while WikiLeaks and Assange struggled to survive. With not a penny going to WikiLeaks, a hyped Guardian book led to a lucrative Hollywood movie deal. The book\u2019s authors, Luke Harding and David Leigh, gratuitously abused Assange as a \u201cdamaged personality\u201d and \u201ccallous\u201d. They also revealed the secret password Julian had given the Guardian in confidence and which was designed to protect a digital file containing the U.S. embassy cables. With Assange now trapped in the Ecuadorean embassy, Harding, who had enriched himself on the backs of both Julian Assange and Edward Snowden, stood among the police outside the embassy and gloated on his blog that \u201cScotland Yard may get the last laugh\u201d. The question is why. Julian Assange has committed no crime. He has never been charged with a crime. The Swedish episode was bogus and farcical and he has been vindicated.

The Sharia is being implemented in the United Kingdom and the Muslims are ready to seek total control. The latest evidence of that fact is the suspension of a firefighter who simply voiced his support for the English Defence League's founder, Tommy Robinson. A firefighter with Nottinghamshire Fire and Rescue Service took to Facebook to state that he had been suspended from his job over giving support to Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, aka Tommy Robinson.

Now, a firefighter has taken to his social media account \u201cJono Booth\u201d and claims to have been suspended after supporting Robinson on Facebook. The open account account messaged publicly in support of jailed Robinson. After a number of messages, the account claimed the firefighter was leaving Nottinghamshire Fire and Rescue Service after being suspended over his conduct on Facebook. The post read: \u201cWell after 22 years in the fire service as a firefighter for Nottinghamshire, yesterday I had a phone call from the fire service saying that I\u2019ve been suspended from duty with immediate effect and I had to hand in my on call alerter and photo I.D card. \u201cOn asking for what reason this was happening I was told I was going to be investigated on some of the content I had recently put on Facebook.\u201d He added: \u201cSince yesterday morning\u2019s phone call from them I have since handed my notice in at the fire service. \u201cFirefighter Booth signing off.\u201d\u2026 Robinson was arrested, tried, and sentenced to 13 months within an hour for simply reporting outside a criminal trial involving a Muslim rape gang at Leeds Crown Court. The judge also put a gag on the press so they were not allowed to report on the arrest, and many reputable outlets complied by removing their stories. Robinson was denied due process, according to the judge. Robinson has been at the forefront of exposing the criminal elements in Islam. Just last week I reported on his previous comments about being incarcerated earlier and that it might be a plot to get rid of him in prison. This isn't far-fetched. In March, we reported on Britain First's Paul Golding was attacked by two inmates at HMP Elmley, on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent. Golding was found guilty on 7 March at Folkestone Magistrates\u2019 Court of religiously-aggravated harassment alongside deputy leader Jayda Fransen which they carried out in Kent in May last year. The court heard the pair launched a political campaign in which they claimed to be trying to expose Muslim men who were the subject of a rape trial. So, expose the Islamists fro who and what they are and what Islam's founder not only taught them, but modeled for them, and you may just find yourself in jail in the UK. Sadly, the same scenario is making some strides in the US, as well. Free Tommy Robinson protests are set for this weekend, and Dutch MP Geert Wilders has said he will join those protests. Wilders has called Robinson's imprisonment a \"disgrace.\" He told Breitbart: Tommy Robinson was arrested on May 25 outside Leeds Crown Court after using social media to broadcast details of an ongoing trial which was subject to reporting restrictions. He was arrested, brought before a judge, and sentenced within five hours. The judge ordered a media ban on his arrest and imprisonment, even forcing British publications to delete their articles about the case. Such measures are common practice in North Korea and Saudi Arabia. It is sad to see how Britain, the cradle of Western democracy and the rule of law, is fast descending into tyranny. Tommy is a hero. It is a disgrace that he is still in jail. I have been invited to a major protest demonstration in London next week, and I will be coming. Free Tommy now. Indeed!

And, just for good measure he accused the people accusing him \u2013 victims of sexual abuse by Barros\u2019 mentor, the convicted sex-predator Karadima \u2013 of committing \u201ccalumny\u201d? [1] And remember when Cardinal O\u2019Malley told the pope off in public over the \u201cpain\u201d these accusations had caused the victims of sexual abuse? And then remember how the pope had apologised-except-not-really because the accusations are, after all, still lies, and that there\u2019s still \u201cno evidence\u201d against Barros\u2026? The press, secular as well as Catholic, is full this week of the story that the pope did indeed see evidence of Barros\u2019 complicity in Karadima\u2019s sexual abuse \u2013 not only that Barros had helped to cover it up but that he had been present and a direct witness at the time and therefore a passive participant. Nicole Winfield and the Associated Press dropped the bomb that the information came directly from the victims, whom Francis had dismissed and refused to meet with on his trip, and delivered through his own Commission on sexual abuse: Pope Francis received a victim\u2019s letter in 2015 that graphically detailed how a priest sexually abused him and how other Chilean clergy ignored it, contradicting the pope\u2019s recent insistence that no victims had come forward to denounce the cover-up, the letter\u2019s author and members of Francis\u2019 own sex- abuse commission have told The Associated Press. The fact that Francis received the eight-page letter, obtained by the AP, challenges his insistence that he has \u201czero tolerance\u201d for sex abuse and cover-ups. It also calls into question his stated empathy with abuse survivors, compounding the most serious crisis of his five-year papacy. Now it appears that Francis had also overruled a 2015 warning from the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith that Barros should not be made a bishop. The Italian Catholic daily La Nuova Bussola Quotidiana reports that not only did the pope see a letter from victims, but that the CDF, under Muller, \u201chad already conducted an preliminary investigation into Barros and the other bishops close to Karadima which had led to the decision to relieve them of their duties.\u201d \u201cBut with a letter signed by the Pope in January 2015 and sent to the Chilean bishops, the request for exemption is blocked and shortly thereafter Barros is promoted to\u2026Osorno.\u201d The article points out that while Karadima was convicted by a Vatican tribunal on the testimony of the victims, it is the same testimony of the same victim-witnesses that Francis now dismisses in the accusations against Barros. The accusations that stood against Karadima come from the same sources as those against Barros, who the victims said was in the room watching at the time. While the specifics are still not known, readers may be reminded by this of a peculiar incident about a year later in which Pope Francis summarily ordered the dismissal of three priests of the CDF, whose remit was investigations of clerics accused of sexual abuse. The website One Peter Five reports, via Marco Tosatti, that the pope ordered their removal without offering any explanation to then-cardinal prefect Gerhard Muller. When, after several attempts and three months later[2], Muller was able to get an audience with the pope to ask the reason, he received the response, \u201cI am the pope, I do not need to give reasons for any of my decisions. I have decided that they have to leave and they have to leave.\u201d Marco Tosatti reports the CDF incident, but it follows an odd story of a meeting of curial officials to discuss certain bishop appointments. Without naming names, (or, frustratingly, giving dates[3]) Tosatti relates: \u201cIt was some time ago to make a bishop, not in Italy. The nuncio has prepared the triad [the \u201cterna\u201d or list of three candidates]. A cardinal, head of the dicastery, perhaps the same holder of the Congregation for Bishops, during the ordinary assembly took the floor, saying: \u2018The first candidate indicated is excellent, the second is good. But I would like to warn of the third, whom I know well, since he was a seminarian, and who presents problems both on the level of doctrine and morality. He responds little to the necessary criteria. But the third was a friend of someone and another cardinal, of the circle currently in power, has flung himself at his colleague, accusing him of impropriety.\u2019 The meeting ended without further decisions.\u201d Whatever the details of these strange incidents, what is clear in Chile is that no amount of eyewitness testimony was going to make the slightest difference. Bergoglio wanted Barros as a bishop and that was that. Even while \u201capologising\u201d the pope had doubled down when questioned about it by journalists, saying, \u201cYou, in all good will, tell me that there are victims, but I haven\u2019t seen any, because they haven\u2019t come forward.\u201d \u201cIn the case of Barros it\u2019s been observed, it\u2019s been studied; there\u2019s no evidence. The best thing to do if someone believes it\u2019s the case is to come forward quickly with evidence.\u201d The AP report, however, says exactly the opposite; that members of his own (now defunct[4]) abuse Commission had approached Cardinal O\u2019Malley, the pope\u2019s \u201ctop abuse advisor,\u201d with the letter to deliver to the pope. Marie Collins, the Irish abuse survivor and Commission member who resigned, citing the Vatican\u2019s refusal to take meaningful action, told AP, \u201cWhen we gave him [O\u2019Malley] the letter for the pope, he assured us he would give it to the pope and speak of the concerns. And at a later date, he assured us that that had been done.\u201d Juan Carlos Cruz, the Karadima victim whose membership on the Commission the Vatican had blocked, told AP, \u201cCardinal O\u2019Malley called me after the\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

The big frigid blue ball is the farthest planet from the Sun \u2014 since we don\u2019t count Pluto as a planet anymore \u2014 and it hasn\u2019t been studied with the same intensity of many of the others. Thankfully the Hubble Space Telescope hasn\u2019t lost interest in the distant planet, because it just captured one of Neptunes massive storms losing steam as it roars across the planet. Storms on Neptune appear as giant dark ovals, a bit like Jupiter\u2019s Great Red Spot. However, unlike Jupiter\u2019s centuries-old storm, Neptune\u2019s hurricane-like weather events only last a few years at a time before eventually dissipating. Of course, that\u2019s not to say the storms are insignificant \u2014 many are large enough to swallow and entire continent here on Earth \u2014 so watching one breathe its dying gasps is still a special sight. The planet, which NASA says is the windiest in our Solar System, hosts regular storms which appear as large spots on its surface, but scientists are still at a loss as to how they actually occur. \u201cWe have no evidence of how these vortices are formed or how fast they rotate,\u201d Agust\u00edn S\u00e1nchez-Lavega of the University of the Basque Country in Spain explains. \u201cIt is most likely that they arise from an instability in the sheared eastward and westward winds.\u201d The observation of this particular storm dying out is significant because it\u2019s the very first time one of Neptune\u2019s storms has been observed in such a way. It also goes against everything that scientists thought they knew about how forms on Neptune live and die. \u201cIt looks like we\u2019re capturing the demise of this dark vortex, and it\u2019s different from what well-known studies led us to expect,\u201d said Michael H. Wong of the University of California at Berkeley says. \u201cTheir dynamical simulations said that anticyclones under Neptune\u2019s wind shear would probably drift toward the equator. We thought that once the vortex got too close to the equator, it would break up and perhaps create a spectacular outburst of cloud activity.\u201d But this storm stayed its course, dying out in a horizontal path that didn\u2019t bring it towards the Neptunian equator at all, forcing scientists to go back to the drawing board and come up with a new theory on the planet\u2019s weather habits.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

Watching the full exchange it is obvious that Trump was making a sincere effort to answer Acosta\u2019s questions, the president actually took the time to answer three of his questions before losing his patients with an argumentative Acosta who refused to hand the mic over to the female intern forcefully pushing her arm away. Acosta can deny how the altercation took place, but the video shows the facts, which are that Acosta was out of line. The lawsuit was announced by CNN on Tuesday. The network is also asking the court for an \u201cimmediate restraining order requiring the pass be returned to Jim.\u201d Both CNN and Acosta are plaintiffs in the lawsuit, and there are six defendants: Donald Trump himself, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders, Chief of Staff John Kelly, his aide for communication Bill Shine, Secret Service Director Joseph Clancy, and the unidentified Secret Service officer who took the pass from Acosta. Fox News reports: \u201cThe wrongful revocation of these credentials violates CNN and Acosta\u2019s First Amendment rights of freedom of the press, and their Fifth Amendment rights to due process,\u201d CNN said in a statement. \u201cWe have asked the court for an immediate restraining order requiring the pass to be returned to Jim, and will seek permanent relief as part of this process.\u201d CNN added that \u201cthe suit is specific to CNN and Acosta,\u201d but said it could happen to anyone. \u201cIf left unchallenged, the actions of the White house would create a dangerous chilling effect for any journalist who covers our elected officials,\u201d CNN said. This morning, CNN filed a lawsuit against @realDonaldTrump and top aides. The White House has violated CNN and @Acosta's First Amendment rights of freedom of the press and Fifth Amendment rights to due process. Complaint: https://t.co/43oX6L8xA7 pic.twitter.com/RvJ0Cgh6oi \u2014 CNN Communications (@CNNPR) November 13, 2018 The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Last week, Acosta\u2019s press pass to access the White House was suspended \u201cuntil further notice\u201d after he engaged in the contentious back-and-forth over the migrant caravan working its way up through Mexico. Trump characterizes the caravan as \u201can invasion,\u201d a term to which Acosta objected. \u201cHonestly, I think you should let me run the country and you run CNN,\u201d the president said. The reporter tried to ask him another question before a female White House aide walked over to him. Trump then told him, \u201cThat\u2019s enough!\u201d Acosta continued to try to talk as the intern was seen trying to take the microphone from his hand. She grabbed the microphone but Acosta wouldn\u2019t give it up and there was brief contact between the two. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said the suspension of his press credentials stemmed from his \u201cplacing his hands on a young woman just trying to do her job as a White House intern.\u201d She called the behavior \u201cabsolutely unacceptable.\u201d Several news outlets accused Sanders of using a \u201cdoctored\u201d video as evidence, but the press secretary didn\u2019t back down from her decision. \u201cWe stand by our decision to revoke this individual\u2019s hard pass. We will not tolerate the inappropriate behavior clearly documented in this video,\u201d Sanders tweeted to accompany the allegedly doctored video. White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway has since said the video was simply \u201csped up.\u201d An attorney for CNN and Acosta followed up with a separate statement, saying the law is \u201cclear\u201d that the Trump administration violated the First Amendment and Due process Clause.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

Pamela Geller and Robert Spencer co-founded anti-Muslim group Stop Islamization of America. They were due to speak at an English Defence League march in Woolwich, where Drummer Lee Rigby was killed. A government spokesman said individuals whose presence \"is not conducive to the public good\" could be excluded by the home secretary. He added: \"We condemn all those whose behaviours and views run counter to our shared values and will not stand for extremism in any form.\" 'Right decision' Ms Geller, of the Atlas Shrugs blog, and Mr Spencer, of Jihad Watch, are also co-founders of the American Freedom Defense Initiative, best known for a pro-Israel \"Defeat Jihad\" poster campaign on the New York subway. On both of their blogs the pair called their bans from entering the UK \"a striking blow against freedom\" and said the \"the nation that gave the world the Magna Carta is dead\". They were due to attend a march planned by the far-right EDL to mark Armed Forces Day on 29 June, ending in Woolwich, south east London, where soldier Drummer Rigby was murdered last month. Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, who had called for the bloggers to be banned from the UK, said: \"I welcome the home secretary's ban on Pamela Geller and Robert Spencer from entering the country. This is the right decision. The UK should never become a stage for inflammatory speakers who promote hate.\" EDL leader Tommy Robinson, meanwhile, criticised the decision and said Ms Geller and Mr Spencer were coming to the UK to lay flowers at the place where Drummer Rigby died. \"It's embarrassing for this so-called land of democracy and freedom of speech,\" he said. \"How many hate preachers are living in this country? It just shows what sort of a two-tier system we have here.\" 'Foster hatred' Anti-fascism campaigners Hope Not Hate had campaigned for the pair to not be allowed into the UK. A researcher with the organisation, Matthew Collins, said it was \"delighted\" with the decision. \"These two are among some of the most extreme anti-Muslim activists in the world. They've nothing to contribute to life in this country. \"They're not here to contribute to good community relations. They only wanted to come here and help the EDL stir up more trouble. Britain doesn't need more hate even just for a few days.\" Mr Spencer put up a copy of what appears to be the exclusion decision from the Home Office on the Jihad Watch website, while Ms Geller posted a copy of her letter on her website, Atlas Shrugs. The letters, both dated Tuesday, claim that both activists have fallen within the scope of a list of unacceptable behaviours by making statements which may \"foster hatred\" and lead to \"inter-community violence\" in the UK. Both letters gave examples of anti-Muslim views stated by both and went on to say that should they be allowed to enter the UK the home secretary believes they would \"continue to espouse such views\".\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

How Do You Like Paying For Sexual Harassment Settlements from Your Congress, America? Please help support us with cryptocurrency donations. Thank you! We finally have the official numbers, and they aren\u2019t pretty. Reid Wilson, a correspondent for the Hill, has posted to Twitter a year by year breakdown of sexual harassment settlements and awards that he received from the Congressional Office of Compliance. I went ahead and added up each column, and what I discovered is that 264 cases of sexual harassment in Congress have been settled since 1997, and the total amount awarded in those settlements comes to a grand total of $17,250,854. So where has the $17,250,854 come from to pay those settlements? That money has come from the taxpayers of course. That means that you and I have been paying to cover up the epidemic of sexual harassment that has been taking place on Capitol Hill. When U.S. Representative Jackie Speier originally told us that more than 15 million dollars had been paid out to victims of sexual harassment in recent years, I was envisioning a few dozen cases at most. I had no idea that the total number of cases would actually be well over 200. If our leaders were serious about stopping this from happening, they would pass a law making it mandatory that all cases of sexual harassment in Congress be made public, and that members of Congress would be personally responsible for paying out any settlements. If such a law was instituted, I guarantee you that sexual harassment on Capitol Hill would come to a screeching halt. But they don\u2019t want it to stop. For many in Congress, having so many attractive young women around is one of the key benefits of the job. I included the following quote from CNN in an article the other day, but I also believe that it fits just perfectly here\u2026 In an environment with \u201cso many young women,\u201d said one ex-House aide, the men \u201chave no self-control.\u201d \u201cAmongst ourselves, we know,\u201d a former Senate staffer said of the lawmakers with the worst reputations. And sometimes, the sexual advances from members of Congress or senior aides are reciprocated in the hopes of advancing one\u2019s career \u2014 what one political veteran bluntly referred to as a \u201csex trade on Capitol Hill.\u201d Do you want to stop this from happening? It isn\u2019t going to stop until we boot out the corrupt career politicians that are engaging in this type of behavior. So I am asking you to support my campaign and other \u201cgrassroots deplorables\u201d that are running for office all over the nation. Morality really matters when it comes to serving in public office, and we are not going to send people that engage in sexually inappropriate behavior to Washington anymore. And I am calling on Congress to immediately release the details of all of the 264 cases of sexual harassment that have been settled since 1997. The American people have a right to know, and those that engaged in this type of behavior do not have a right to hide. It is time to drain the swamp, and this would be a really good place to start.

Officials warn that it\u2019s inevitable that this bacterial infection that\u2019s infected over 2000 people will become resistant to antibiotics. The only way to treat a person who has contracted the plague is with antibiotics. But experts now warn that because they are being used so much to treat the infection, antibiotics resistance is inevitable and making this disease much more terrifying. Once the bacteria is resistant, the Madagascar healthcare system will be overwhelmed, and the disease will have control of the nation. According to the Daily Mail, Madagascar\u2019s healthcare system will be unable to cope if the deadly plague outbreak continues to escalate, a scientist has warned. Scores of doctors and nurses have been struck down with the disease, which is predicted to gather momentum in the coming weeks and there are growing fears hospitals will be unable to meet the illness\u2019 burden. Official figures reveal at least 2,034 people have been infected with the \u201cmedieval disease\u201d so far in what has been described as the \u201cworst outbreak in 50 years.\u201d The black death outbreak has so far claimed at least 165 lives. Although the plague is responding well to antibiotics right now, drug resistance is also an increasing concern amongst experts who predict it will vastly accelerate the disease\u2019s death toll. Professor John Joe McFadden from the University of Surrey told MailOnline: \u201cFortunately in [the] plague, it has not developed much antibiotic resistance. If that kicks in, the plague will be far, far scarier. If you throw more and more antibiotics at patients, antibiotic resistance is more or less inevitable.\u201d Dr. Derek Gatherer, from Lancaster University\u2019s biomedical and life-sciences department, told MailOnline the country would struggle \u201cto cope\u201d if cases continue to spiral. \u201cMadagascar, typically like many African countries, doesn\u2019t have many doctors. There are around three-and-a-half thousand doctors for 22 million people. They only have around 6,000 hospital beds, so they aren\u2019t particularly well positioned to cope with these kind of events. And if it wasn\u2019t for the international aid coming in things would definitely be much worse for them.\u201d And experts continue to fear the healthcare system is on the brink of being overwhelmed. Should the disease actually spread to the African mainland, it will be all but impossible to control and the health care system would certainly be unable to handle the outbreak at that point, making a global pandemic much more likely.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

He\u2019s the heroic security guard that allegedly located the Las Vegas shooter, Steven Paddock. But the narrative surrounding him has changed wildly since the authorities mentioned him, and now, he\u2019s mysteriously vanished into thin air. Of course, this leads many to believe that Campos didn\u2019t even exist, to begin with. His mere existence appears to have been fabricated by the very authorities who are cramming lies down our throats about this massacre for the sake of political agendas. There are two conflicting timelines of Campos\u2019s injury, but what the media has so far made clear, is that they want the public to believe Campos was walking down the Mandalay Bay Hotel & Casino\u2019s 32nd floor hallway, when Stephen Paddock spotted him on a camera he\u2019d allegedly set up in a room service cart, just outside his suite. Once he saw Campos, Paddock reportedly fired nearly 200 rounds through his suite door, wounding Campos in the leg. Moments later (6 minutes actually, according to the newly revised timeline regarding Campos) Paddock allegedly opened fire on a crowd killing more than 50 and injuring nearly 500. But Campos has been a mysterious subject since being wounded in the first moments of Paddock\u2019s assault. After speaking to hotel and law enforcement officials, Campos was scheduled to appear on local Las Vegas television for an interview but went missing just moments before he was supposed to be on the air. David Hickey, a spokesman for the Security, Police, and Fire Professionals of America (SPFPA), Campos\u2019s union, said he got a text that Campos had been taken to an urgent care facility, UMC Quick Care. But UMC Quick Care says none of their clinics filled out an intake request for a patient by that name, and Campos has been silent since the text; vanishing into thin air. He also isn\u2019t listed on the registry that shows the names of licensed security guards in Nevada. \u201cRight now I\u2019m just concerned where my member is, and what his condition is. It\u2019s highly unusual,\u201d Hickey told media. \u201cI\u2019m hoping everything is OK with him and I\u2019m sure MGM or the union will let (media) know when we hear something,\u201d he said. In the meantime, authorities still have not released a conclusive timeline for the shooting they desperately want us to believe was committed by Paddock.

            "question": "Which of the following tactics is used in the following text?\n\nArticle: Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal Archbishop Bernard Hebda of St. Paul, MN, responds to the McCarrick scandal (The Catholic Spirit): Every time Mass is celebrated, the priest prays that Jesus will \u201clook not on our sins but on the faith of [his] Church\u2026 .\u201d That\u2019s been an important prayer for me in the time that I have been serving this archdiocese, well aware of our sins but equally aware of the strong and vibrant faith of this local Church. I\u2019ve been praying that prayer even more earnestly in these past weeks as the Church in the United States has once again come face-to-face with its sins, with reports that former cardinal Theodore McCarrick, one of the most prominent Churchmen in the United States in the last quarter century, has been accused of abusing two minors and sexually harassing or assaulting a number of seminarians and young priests. To make matters worse (if that is even possible), evidence has surfaced that indicates that a bishop, as well as some priests and laity, had brought the allegations about misconduct with seminarians to the attention of Church authorities but to no avail: Archbishop McCarrick was nonetheless \u201cpromoted\u201d to become the archbishop in our nation\u2019s capital, and elevated to the College of Cardinals. While I realize that it is not always easy to evaluate the credibility of those bringing allegations, and that there\u2019s often a tendency to believe those we know over those we don\u2019t, I don\u2019t think that the Church in the United States will rest \u2014 and confidence will be restored \u2014 until the matter is independently investigated and explained, and assurances are given that there are safeguards in place to make sure that something like this couldn\u2019t happen again. The matter has been particularly troubling to me personally due to the fact that I had served in the Archdiocese of Newark as coadjutor archbishop from November 4, 2013, to March 25, 2016, when I was named archbishop here. It was while I was in Newark that I was introduced to then-Cardinal McCarrick. A number of good Catholics have written to ask for a personal accounting on my part, inquiring whether I was made aware in my time in Newark of the 2005 and 2007 settlements involving Archbishop McCarrick, or if I knew of any allegations against him. I can state unequivocally that I learned of those settlements only in June of this year, as news broke about the unrelated claim that had been filed in the Archdiocese of New York. What I know of the settlements I know from the newspapers. When serving in Newark, I was regularly briefed on current legal matters of all sorts, but not on past legal matters (unless they were still being discussed in the press). By the time I arrived in Newark in November 2013, the 2005 and 2007 settlements were apparently considered ancient history. It would be untrue to state that I had never heard any allegations about Cardinal McCarrick. Years before I ever lived in Newark, and never imagining that I would be assigned there, I had indeed read \u2014 as a somewhat geeky ex-lawyer \u2014 an allegation about Cardinal McCarrick in the context of a 2005 lawsuit in the Southern District of New York against Archbishop Myers, Cardinal Eagan, Bishop Hubbard and the Irish Christian Brothers. While the complaint didn\u2019t supply any details, the plaintiff was reported to have said to a journalist that \u201cArchbishop McCarrick would share a bed with seminarians but not engage in any activity with them.\u201d The complaint would later be formally amended to include that allegation. Knowing, however, that this lawsuit was completely dismissed by the state and federal courts, I never gave the particular allegation about Cardinal McCarrick any credence. I can also state without exception that no one in my years in Newark ever told me that they were improperly touched by Archbishop McCarrick, and no one ever told me that they had to share a bed with him or that they had seen anyone share a bed with him. I heard lots of gut-wrenching stories in my two-and-a-half years there, but none of them involved Archbishop McCarrick. With St. John Paul II\u2019s 1995 visit, he was remembered for \u201cbringing a saint to Newark,\u201d not as an abuser of seminarians, minors or priests. When I was installed here in St. Paul, he joined me at lunch along with my father, sister, godmother and then 12-year-old nephew. I can assure you that I would never have allowed that to happen if I had any reason to know or even suspect the things that have been reported in the newspapers this past month. While the letters and emails of recent days are sober reminders that there\u2019s still a long way to go in restoring trust, I nonetheless welcome the efforts to hold me accountable to you, the faithful of this archdiocese. The events of these past weeks have shown that no one can be above the law, regardless of rank or privilege. I was grateful for the opportunity to reinforce that with our seminarians this past weekend, and I look forward to continuing my work with the Office of Ministerial Standards and Safe Environment, and our Archdiocesan Review Board, in creating a culture in which no one need be afraid or reluctant to bring forth an allegation of misconduct. Our heavenly patron, St. Paul, reminds us that \u201cwhere sin abounds, grace abounds all the more.\u201d May these difficult days be days of great grace for this local Church. REMNANT COMMENT: While we certainly appreciate His Excellency's candid explanation of what he knew and did not know about this horrific scandal in the Church, we would also humbly beg him to take it one step further by publicly proclaiming his profession of belief in the Church's official teaching against the mortal sin of homosexual acts and the so-called \"gay lifestyle,\" which includes her long-held teaching that homosexual\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

What appears to be muzzle flashes emitting from multiple aircraft can be seen on numerous videos captured on the night of the massacre. LAS VEGAS (INTELLIHUB) \u2014 Newly released footage of the October 1 massacre posted on YouTube by the NICK VEGAS channel appears to confirm what Intellihub\u2019s founder and editor-in-chief Shepard Ambellas pointed out in late October when he presented evidence of the strategic air assault on The Alex Jones Show in great detail. The video shows what appears to be muzzle flashes emanating from the airspace between the Delano Hotel and Mandalay Bay, an airspace that should be free of obstruction altogether. A major analysis of this matter was done by Ambellas in mid-November which revealed that no aircraft should be occupying that airspace between the hours of 10:05 and 10:15 p.m. on the night of the shooting (i.e. no aircraft are visible on the radar in that airspace during that time.) Not to mention the fact that helicopters are not allowed to hover in the City of Las Vegas without a permit nor are they allowed to lurk behind buildings lower than their roof lines. The first of a series of muzzles flashes can be seen coming from several different elevations, possibly from as many as 3 aircraft (helicopters). The flashes which are not consistent with FAA required running lights in any way can be seen starting at 0:19 seconds into the video. Note: To see the flashes you must view the video on \u20181080p\u2019 and set it to \u2018full screen\u2019 and look between the two hotels (adjust the video speed to 25%.) The exact same aircraft and apparent muzzles flashes can also be seen in the Arch Angel Studios \u201cFirst Shots\u201d video which was posted to YouTube on Oct. 2, just one day after the shooting. #LasVegasShooting\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

The paper noted that \u201cthe phones started ringing at the Texas Home School Coalition, and they haven\u2019t stopped yet.\u201d The Times added:The Lubbock-based organization has been swamped with inquiries for months from parents seeking safer options for their kids in the aftermath of this year\u2019s deadly school massacres, first in Parkland and then in Santa Fe, Texas. \u201cWhen the Parkland shooting happened, our phone calls and emails exploded,\u201d said coalition president Tim Lambert. \u201cIn the last couple of months, our numbers have doubled. We\u2019re dealing with probably between 1,200 and 1,400 calls and emails per month, and prior to that it was 600 to 700.\u201d While the debate rages anew over familiar topics following such tragedies \u2014 tougher, more restrictive gun control laws and bolstering security at public schools \u2014 the revolution in homeschooling has been taking place quietly, behind the scenes and off the radar screens of most political organizations. But again, it\u2019s not just the shootings, which admittedly have increased in the past couple of years. Christopher Chin, head of Homeschool Louisiana, told The Times that parents are fed up with \u201cthe violence, the bullying, the unsafe environments.\u201d The Left is driving more kids OUT of public schools There is also the Left-wing social engineering. The craziness over transgender students and bathrooms/locker rooms, allowing students to \u201ctake a knee\u201d during the playing of the National Anthem, the Left-wing curriculum, and refusing to allow students to wear shirts that praise POTUS Trump or feature the American flag are also driving parents into homeschooling. REMNANT COMMENT: We here at The Remnant are always eager to promote the home-schooling movement, and this report helps illustrate why. At the moment and personally speaking, my own family\u2019s home-school is going great guns. We have a daughter still in high school and three in grade school. Our family couldn't be happier with our decision to homeschool---yes, all the way through high school. And as for our older home-schooled children: My third-eldest child is preparing to head off to college in the fall. Her older sister just finished a semester studying in Austria and will graduate with a double major and a minor degree next spring. My son will be a junior this fall, working on a Mass Communications degree at Franciscan University. Here's an example of his work: Perhaps this video from a couple of years ago will be useful to those considering home-schooling this fall: Friends, please give serious thought and prayer to home-schooling your children. I realize it\u2019s a challenge, but few challenges have greater payoffs in this world or the next. There is no better way to keep the Catholic family together and committed to the Catholic restoration than the Catholic home school.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

The infectious disease also has a fatality rate of almost 90% making it much more deadly than the black death plaguing Madagascar. A deadly outbreak of a rare and highly fatal virus has broken out in eastern Uganda and five cases have already been identified, the World Health Organization (WHO) has confirmed. The disease is known as the Marburg virus. It is similar to the Ebola virus and can be fatal in up to 88% of cases. The outbreak of the contagious and deadly Marburg virus disease in the Kween district of eastern Uganda was declared by the nation\u2019s Ministry of Health back on October 19. Since then, five cases have been identified as international aid agencies, stretched thin by Madagascar\u2019s black death outbreak, have rushed to deploy teams on the ground to control the recent outbreak. This news comes amid a surge in cases of plague in Madagascar, which is considered to be the \u201cworst outbreak in 50 years\u201d and now at \u201ccrisis\u201d point. Marburg virus disease (MVD), which causes severe viral hemorrhagic fever, ranks among the most virulent pathogens known to infect humans, according to the World Health Organization. The WHO website reads: \u201cMarburg virus disease is a rare disease with a high mortality rate for which there is no specific treatment. The virus is transmitted by direct contact with the blood, body fluids, and tissues of infected persons or wild animals (e.g. monkeys and fruit bats).\u201d MVD also falls within the same family as the Ebola virus \u2013 the hemorrhagic fever that decimated West Africa and killed around 11,000 in 2014 and 2015. The outbreak is thought to have begun in September when a man in his 30s, who worked as a game hunter and lived near a cave with a heavy presence of bats, was admitted to a local health center with a high fever, vomiting, and diarrhea. The man\u2019s condition deteriorated quickly and he failed to respond to antimalarial treatments. He died after being taken to another hospital, and a short time later, his sister in her 50\u2019s also died of the same ailment. Emergency screening has begun at the Kenya-Uganda border in Turkana after all three members of the same family died of the disease in Uganda. Health workers have been asked to work with communities to stop the deadly Marburg outbreak from devastating communities in the rural region. Dr. Zabulon Yoti, a Technical Coordinator for Emergencies at the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Africa, said: \u201cCommunity engagement is the cornerstone of emergency response.\u201d He urged health officials to \u201cwork with the communities to build their capacity for success and sustainability\u201d and develop a better understanding of the local customs and traditions. Early symptoms include fever, chills, headache, and myalgia (muscle pain). Several hundred people have been exposed to the virus as officials worry this outbreak could spread rapidly into regions already devastated by the ongoing black death outbreak.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

For us, Hungary is first.\" \u201cWe will fight those who want to change the Christian identity of Hungary and Europe,\u201d Orban concluded.

Over the weekend, Belgian prime minister Charles Michel spoke about sending \u201can ultimatum\u201d to the Visegr\u00e1d countries which \u201creject solidarity\u201d. The essence of this ultimatum would be that if by the end of June a consensus is not reached in the council of EU heads of government, then the planned reforms would be adopted with a qualified majority vote which would overrule dissenters. Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade P\u00e9ter Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3 said on Tuesday,\u201cHungary will not become an immigrant country, it has never admitted and will never admit illegal immigrants.\" He also referred to Michel's ultimatum as unacceptable and shocking. \u201cHungary has never admitted and will never admit illegal immigrants, irrespective of whether there is any pressure in this direction along the borders or from Brussels,\u201d Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3 said. \u201cThe Belgian Prime Minister\u2019s statement is also outrageous because this is the first time that people in Brussels are openly planning to push the mandatory resettlement quota through by force while totally ignoring the will of certain EU member states.\" \u201cWe regard this whole thing as unacceptable and we reject it,\" he added. \u201cThe countries of the Visegr\u00e1d Group do not support the introduction of any kind of mandatory quota.\u201d \u201cPerhaps it doesn\u2019t bother the Belgian Prime Minister that there are no-go zones in many Western European cities, or that people with immigrant backgrounds have committed 27 major terrorist attacks in Europe recently, but this bothers the V4 because they do not want to live on a continent were the threat of terrorism becomes an everyday regularity,\" he continued. Just this week, we reported that Hungary had grown weary of the talks of pushing illegal Muslim migrants on their country and Europe, and was preparing to walk away from the negotiating table. Orban has taken a tough stance in Hungary. He has ordered all illegal Muslim invaders to get out of Hungary and never come back. In December, he said that he was not concerned with what Brussels wanted, but was determined to defend Hungary's borders. PM Orban has done just that, too. Orban's border wall virtually eliminated illegal immigration. Orban is openly Christian and seems to understand something that many do not and that is you do not allow a wholesale flood of antichrists to pour into your country. Were the Ammonites and Moabites not kept out of the assembly of Israel because of their hatred of the people of God? (Deuteronoy 23:3-6) Yes, they were. While Muslims need the Gospel for sure, one cannot allow such an influx into the country, or all you are asking for is the judgments God warned about in Deuteronomy 28. I say, well done Mr. Orban.

California was one of 20 states led by Washington that won the decision from U.S. District Judge Robert S. Lasnik in Seattle.

When the court case completely collapsed, the media buried the story. Just as it failed to provide any meaningful information about the background of the case. That was in part because it would have been damaging to Obama. And because they didn't care. But President Trump listened to the voices asking him for justice. Today, President Donald J. Trump signed Executive Grants of Clemency (Full Pardons) for Dwight Lincoln Hammond, Jr., and his son, Steven Hammond. The Hammonds are multi-generation cattle ranchers in Oregon imprisoned in connection with a fire that leaked onto a small portion of neighboring public grazing land. The evidence at trial regarding the Hammonds\u2019 responsibility for the fire was conflicting, and the jury acquitted them on most of the charges. At the Hammonds\u2019 original sentencing, the judge noted that they are respected in the community and that imposing the mandatory minimum, 5-year prison sentence would \u201cshock the conscience\u201d and be \u201cgrossly disproportionate to the severity\u201d of their conduct. As a result, the judge imposed significantly lesser sentences. The previous administration, however, filed an overzealous appeal that resulted in the Hammonds being sentenced to five years in prison. This was unjust. Dwight Hammond is now 76 years old and has served approximately three years in prison The same administration that was against mandatory minimums for its drug dealers and gang members went to court to defend mandatory minimums under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act. While Obama pardoned drug dealers and locked up ranchers, Trump pardons ranchers and locks up drug dealers. Both men are currently in prison on five-year sentences, thanks in part to a 1996 antiterrorism law that imposed a mandatory minimum sentence on certain crimes on federal land. The length of their prison terms, in part, fueled outrage at their convictions. Federal Judge Michael Robert Hogan originally gave the Hammonds reduced sentences in 2012, arguing that the mandatory minimums were unjust. But the Obama administration appealed, and federal Judge Ann Aiken in 2015 imposed the full five-year sentences. Hogan was a Bush appointee who respected the law. Aiken was a Dem fundraiser, her husband was the chair of the Oregon Dem party, appointed by Bill Clinton. Aiken was unqualified for her role, except in the ways that mattered to the Clintons and their Dem allies. These pardons cleanse another stain from our nation's history in the dark years of Obama.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

            "question": "Which of the following tactics is used in the following text?\n\nArticle: Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders The Francis Vatican\u2019s approach to the contemplative life is probably the most illustrative of our entire crisis. Contemplative life is aimed only at a purely supernatural end. It has no \u201cuse\u201d in the sense that either the Bergoglians \u2013 in terms of their political machinations \u2013 or the world can understand. There is probably no other place where the differences between the two programmes - the Catholic programme of Christ and the Bergoglian/Kasperian programme - are more sharply contrasted. One aspect of Pope Francis\u2019 character that seems little-explored by the Catholic and secular media alike is his apparent disdain for contemplative religious life \u2013 a facet of Catholic life that could be described as the most purely religious of all the Church\u2019s undertakings. The world does not understand it or want it. Therefore, it is something of a thorn in the Bergoglian side, and he has repeatedly expressed his contempt for it. So when, in 2016 he issued a document on contemplative nuns, the faithful braced for impact . In his recent document, ostensibly on holiness, \u201cGaudete et Exultate,\u201d the pope attacked the religious desire for silence and solitude, to be alone with God in prayer, seeking unity with Him, saying in essence that the Christian life is inherently about social activism, about material, worldly ends. To these foundations of the contemplative life \u2013 indeed of any form of religious life in the Church \u2013 Francis set up another of his false dichotomies, contemplation in opposition to serving others, giving a Jesuit maxim as an imperative for all Catholics: \u201cWe are called to be contemplatives even in the midst of action, and to grow in holiness by responsibly and generously carrying out our proper mission.\u201d Italian Vaticanist Marco Tosatti commented dryly, \u201cRejoice and be glad\u2026 but not if you\u2019re a cloistered contemplative.\u201d In 2016, I wrote that Francis\u2019 Apostolic Constitution, \u201cVultum dei quaerere\u201d was in some respects the most damaging object of the wrecking-ball pontificate to date. Unfortunately, it was about a subject that the world, and therefore the modern Church, cares so little about that hardly anyone noticed. Aimed specifically at female contemplative religious, the document threatened that in a year or so another would be forthcoming laying out precisely what would now be required of nuns to continue in their vocations. The new document issued last week, \u201cCor orans,\u201d is juridical, that is, it is not much more than a list of specific norms, or rules \u2013 289 of them! \u2013 that all communities of contemplative nuns must now follow. One odd remark in article 19 is maybe the most succinct description of the direction planned for contemplatives: \u201cA monastery of nuns, as every religious house, is erected while keeping in mind its usefulness for the Church and for the Institute.\u201d (emphasis added) Wait\u2026 its \u201cusefulness\u201d? I think a fair question for the Faithful to ask this Vatican department might be, \u201cAccording to what specific criteria is a monastery\u2019s \u2018usefulness\u2019 actually determined?\u201d One can\u2019t help but hearken back to the criteria for monasteries that were allowed to survive the revolutionary purges in 18th and 19th century Europe. A house that could prove to the secularists that it was \u201cuseful\u201d \u2013 that it could care for the indigent elderly, teach children or nurse the sick \u2013 would be allowed to continue. Those which were purely contemplative \u2013 a single-minded devotion to the adoration of God \u2013 were closed. It is not an insignificant quirk of modern history, and one that tells us much about the nature of the current pontificate, that houses of contemplatives are always attacked by secularist regimes, from Henry VIII to the Soviet Union. Rupture? What rupture? The first thing Cor orans does is claim continuity with both pre and post-Vatican II theology. In the Introduction, it seems anxious to establish a \u201chermeneutic of continuity\u201d with Pius XII and his document Sponsa Christi Ecclesia of 1950. The authors insist there is no contradiction between the two \u2013 except, of course, where there are contradictions \u2013 and that both Pius XII and Francis are keen to see nuns reaching the \u201caim of their specific vocation.\u201d It describes Francis as promulgating this document \u201cin the wake\u201d of Pius XII[1]. In fact, Pope Francis, by promulgating the Apostolic Constitution Vultum Dei quaerere, on June 29, 2016, to help the contemplatives reach the aim of their specific vocation, invited reflection and discernment on the precise content tied to consecrated life in general and to the monastic tradition in particular, but he did not intend to abrogate Sponsa Christi Ecclesia that was derogated only in some points. As a consequence, the two pontifical documents are to be held as normative in force for monasteries of nuns and must be read in a unitary vision. But of course, the entire game is given away in the next paragraph: Pope Francis, in the wake of the teaching of Pope Pius XII and reaffirmed by Ecumenical Vatican Council II, intended to present in Vultum Dei quaerere the intense and fruitful path taken by the Church in the last decades, in the light of the teachings of the same Council and considering the changed socio-cultural conditions. Yes, that\u2019s what it said. Here\u2019s my translation: \u201cThe Church\u2019s \u2018path\u2019 of the last 50 years has been \u2018fruitful\u2019. How do you know? Because we\u2019re telling you it has.\u201d In other words, there have been absolutely no problems whatever with the direction taken either by the Church or by the religious life since Vatican II. Everything that has happened has been in complete and perfect continuity between the Before Church and the After Church; there has been no rupture or break with the past. All changes undertaken by religious houses were perfectly legitimate and good - \u201cfruitful\u201d if, perhaps, a bit \u201cintense\u201d \u2013 and have been made in \u201clight of the teachings\u201d of Vatican II and \u201cchanged socio-cultural conditions.\u201d There is, therefore, no\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

President Trump has effectively suspended the granting of asylum to migrants who cross illegally. Trump signed the order on Friday, and it went into effect on Saturday. The order means that migrants will have to present themselves at U.S. ports of entry to qualify for asylum and follow other rules unveiled on Thursday that seek to limit asylum claims. After spending almost a week in Mexico City, where many refused to accept asylum from Mexico, the caravan, made up mostly of male Hondurans, but also nationals of other Central American countries, is now on the move towards the United States border. A Ruptly video shows hundreds of people getting on trains in Mexico subway, and boarding heavy trucks or buses somewhere outside the city. Others are seen using cars to continue their trek towards the border. take our poll - story continues below Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?

Meanwhile on the other side of the US border, efforts are being made to reinforce it and make it less penetrable from the outside. The US has deployed 5,200 troops to help border protection thwart what Donald Trump has described as an impending migrant \u201cinvasion.\u201d Troops setting up barb wire under the Hidalgo Reynosa bridge #RGV -Miltares colocan cerca al\u00e1mbrica en la frontera #Texas #Telemundo40 vid @AntonioNewsT40 pic.twitter.com/8cr3XfH2T6 \u2014 Iris Rodriguez (@IrisNews) November 2, 2018 For now, the active-duty servicemen have mainly been erecting barbed-wire fences along the border and building shelter accommodation for customs and border protection staff.

The conversation began normally, with Clinton hypocritically toeing the progressive line of identity politics by explaining how each of the groups are different but can be managed by the same liberal movement: \u201cWhat\u2019s often called political correctness is politeness,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cIt\u2019s not being rude and insulting to people. It\u2019s respecting the diversity that we have in our society,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Democratic Party is a much more diverse political party, attracting people who are African-American, Latino, LGBT, whatever the reason why people feel more comfortable where they are taken in, where they are included as part of a political movement or party.\u201d \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think it\u2019s politically correct to say we value that. And I don\u2019t want to go around insulting people. I don\u2019t want to paint with a broad brush every immigrant is this, every African-American is that, every, you know, other person with different religious beliefs or whatever \u2013 that\u2019s childish.\u201d Childish, indeed. Insulting, indeed. Just 30 seconds later, as Swisher asked: \u201cwhat do you think of Cory Booker\u2026 saying \u2018kick them in the shins,\u2019 essentially\u2026\u201d incorrectly recalling Eric Holder\u2019s recent comments. Which Clinton quickly corrected: \u201cWell that was Eric Holder\u2026\u201d Adding, rather extraordinarily, \u201cYeah, I know they all look alike,\u201d Clinton joked, triggering howls of laughter from the apparently mind-numbed audience. Sorry Hillary, we don\u2019t think they look anything alike. Or did you mean all black people? Finally, we have one question \u2013 what would have happened if Trump said it? As The American Mirror\u2019s Kyle Olsen concludes so eloquently, Hillary Clinton appears to benefit from her progressive privilege \u2013 it is the only thing that protects her from getting the \u2018Roseanne treatment\u2019, and not being dismissed in disgrace.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

We are doing just fine!\u201d .@Theresa_May, don\u2019t focus on me, focus on the destructive Radical Islamic Terrorism that is taking place within the United Kingdom. We are doing just fine! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 30, 2017 I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re doing just fine, but Trump is right that the real problem is jihad terror and Sharia supremacism, and British authorities want to ignore that and shoot the messenger. And so Chris Bryant, \u201ca senior Labour backbencher, has written to May urging her to go further, and issue an official ban on Donald Trump from entering the UK on the grounds he is condoning fascism and his presence is \u2018not conducive to the public good\u2019, a senior Labour MP has said.\u201d For Chris Bryant, apparently \u201cfascism\u201d means \u201cdefense of Britain and its values against jihad terror.\u201d Bryant \u201ccited the cases of two US far-right bloggers, Robert Spencer and Pamela Geller , who were banned by May in 2013 from entering the UK to take part in English Defence League rallies, as precedents for taking action against Trump.\u201d Why are we \u201cfar right\u201d? Everything we do is in defense of the freedom of speech and equality of rights of all people before the law. That\u2019s \u201cfar right\u201d? In any case, note well: the letter to me from the UK Home Office said that I was banned for saying that \u201c[Islam] is a religion and is a belief system that mandates warfare against unbelievers\u2026\u201d That\u2019s a demonstrably true statement. Meanwhile, Britain has a steadily lengthening record of admitting jihad preachers without a moment of hesitation. Syed Muzaffar Shah Qadri\u2019s preaching of hatred and jihad violence was so hardline that he was banned from preaching in Pakistan, but the UK Home Office welcomed him into Britain. The UK Home Office also admitted Shaykh Hamza Sodagar into the country, despite the fact that he has said: \u201cIf there\u2019s homosexual men, the punishment is one of five things. One \u2013 the easiest one maybe \u2013 chop their head off, that\u2019s the easiest. Second \u2013 burn them to death. Third \u2013 throw \u2019em off a cliff. Fourth \u2013 tear down a wall on them so they die under that. Fifth \u2013 a combination of the above.\u201d May\u2019s government admitted two jihad preachers who had praised the murderer of a foe of Pakistan\u2019s blasphemy laws. One of them was welcomed by the Archbishop of Canterbury. Meanwhile, the UK banned three bishops from areas of Iraq and Syria where Christians are persecuted from entering the country. Chris Bryant had nothing to say about any of those jihad preachers entering Britain with no problem. \u201cUK ambassador conveys concerns over Trump retweet to White House,\u201d by Rowena Mason, Guardian, November 30, 2017: \u2026Chris Bryant, a senior Labour backbencher, has written to May urging her to go further, and issue an official ban on Donald Trump from entering the UK on the grounds he is condoning fascism and his presence is \u201cnot conducive to the public good\u201d, a senior Labour MP has said. Bryant, a former Foreign Office minister, said the prime minister should issue a prohibition order against the president like those that apply to other far right figures from the US. He cited the cases of two US far right bloggers, Robert Spencer and Pamela Geller, who were banned by May in 2013 from entering the UK to take part in English Defence League rallies, as precedents for taking action against Trump. In a letter to May, he said: \u201cI am writing to you to ask you and the home secretary to take immediate action to ban the president of the United States, Donald Trump, from entering the United Kingdom, due to his apparent support for far-right groups in this country. \u201cIn retweeting Jayda Fransen\u2019s posts, it is absolutely clear to me that President Trump is supporting and condoning fascism and far-right activity. This activity has frequently taken the form of violence on our streets. Ms Fransen herself has a long history of racism and Islamophobia, some of it criminal.

But the worst news is that the epidemic could explode anytime unleashing the sickness on the globe. At least 128 people have been killed and more than 1,300 infected by the deadlier pneumonic strain of the medieval disease. But the oncoming rainy season could see the number of those infected explode exponentially. The rainy season poses a threat to the containment of the plague because outbreaks of this magnitude often seem to be seasonal. The Foreign Office recently warned that the deadly outbreak is entering its most dangerous phase. Its website said that \u201coutbreaks of plague tend to be seasonal and occur mainly during the rainy season.\u201d The African island\u2019s wet season officially began today and will last until the end of April, meaning the downward trend the plague had seen over the past few days, will likely turn upward again. Because the disease can be spread easily through a cough or sneeze, experts are fearful. It would take just one infected traveler who made it to Africa\u2019s mainland or even nearby British honeymoon paradises like Mauritius, the Maldives or the Seychelles to spread the disease globally. The Seychelles is currently putting anyone traveling from Madagascar into quarantine on arrival as a precaution. The outbreak has been fueled by performing the ancient practice of Famadihana. Famadihana is the \u201cdancing with the dead\u201d ritual which sees locals dig up deceased relatives and dance with them before they are reburied. Just contact with a corpse who\u2019s death was because they contracted the plague could sicken a person. The country\u2019s health chief Willy Randriamarotia said: \u201cIf a person dies of pneumonic plague and is then interred in a tomb that is subsequently opened for a Famadihana, the bacteria can still be transmitted and contaminate whoever handles the body.\u201d The tradition has been banned since the outbreak began, but it is feared ceremonies have taken place regardless as local continue to balk that their rituals have contributed to the outbreak. This latest warning that the rainy season could worsen the outbreak comes on the heels of the reports that British aid workers said the epidemic will get worse before it gets better. Olivier Le Guillou of Action Against Hunger said: \u201cThe epidemic is ahead of us, we have not yet reached the peak.\u201d As many as 50 aid workers are believed to have been among the 1,200 people infected with the more dangerous airborne pneumonic strain of the disease.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

If journalists can't conduct themselves according to these rules, then there is no other option but to.... write more explicit rules! Seriously! \u201cAt this time, however, we have decided not to frame such rules in the hope that professional journalistic norms will suffice to regulate conduct in those places,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cIf unprofessional behavior occurs in those settings, or if a court should decide that explicit rules are required to regulate conduct there, we will be forced to reconsider this decision.\u201d The White House should be telling Judge Kelly where he can take his ruling, but they are trying to look like they are on the high ground while submitting to unconstitutional rulings from a federal judge who should know better. However, here are the new rules released by the White House Press Office. (1) A journalist called upon to ask a question will ask a single question and then will yield the floor to other journalists; (2) At the discretion of the President or other White House official taking questions, a follow-up question or questions may be permitted; and where a follow up has been allowed and asked, the questioner will then yield the floor; (3) \u201cYielding the floor\u201d includes, when applicable, physically surrendering the microphone to White House staff for use by the next questioner; (4) Failure to abide by any of rules (1)-(3) may result in suspension or revocation of the journalist\u2019s hard pass. I can see this going way downhill. If you want to deal with people like Acosta, at the moment they begin to show who and what they really are, stop calling on them for questions.

Back in the 2008 presidential race, I explained to then-candidate Rudy Giuliani the concept of \u201cblowback.\u201d Years of US meddling and military occupation of parts of the Middle East motivated a group of terrorists to carry out attacks against the United States on 9/11. They didn\u2019t do it because we are so rich and so free, as the neocons would have us believe. They came over here because we had been killing Muslims \u201cover there\u201d for decades. How do we know this? Well, they told us. Osama bin Laden made it clear why al-Qaeda sought to attack the US. They didn\u2019t like the US taking sides in the Israel-Palestine conflict and they didn\u2019t like US troops on their holy land. Why believe a terrorist, some responded. As I explained to Giuliani ten years ago, the concept of \u201cblowback\u201d is well-known in the US intelligence community and particularly by the CIA. take our poll - story continues below Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?

Unfortunately, it is clear that Giuliani never really understood what I was trying to tell him. Like the rest of the neocons, he either doesn\u2019t get it or doesn\u2019t want to get it. In a recent speech to the MeK \u2013 a violent Islamist-Marxist cult that spent two decades on the US terror watch list \u2013 Giuliani promised that the Trump Administration had made \u201cregime change\u201d a priority for Iran. He even told the members of that organization \u2013 an organization that has killed dozens of Americans \u2013 that Trump would put them in charge of Iran! Giuliani shares with numerous other neocons like John Bolton a strong relationship with this group. In fact, both Giuliani and Bolton have been on the payroll of the MeK and have received tens of thousands of dollars to speak to their followers. This is another example of how foreign lobbies and special interest groups maintain an iron grip on our foreign policy. Does anyone really think Iran will be better off if Trump puts a bunch of \u201cformer\u201d terrorists in charge of the country? How did that work in Libya? It\u2019s easy to dismiss the bombastic Giuliani as he speaks to his financial benefactors in the MeK. Unfortunately, however, Giuliani\u2019s claims were confirmed late last week, when the Washington Free Beacon published a three-page policy paper being circulated among National Security Council officials containing plans to spark regime change in Iran. The paper suggests that the US focus on Iran\u2019s many ethnic minority groups to spark unrest and an eventual overthrow of the government. This is virtually the same road map that the US has followed in Iraq, Libya, Syria, and so on. The results have been unmitigated disaster after disaster. Unleashing terrorists on Iran to overthrow its government is not only illegal and immoral: it\u2019s also incredibly stupid. We know from 9/11 that blowback is real, even if Giuliani and the neocons refuse to understand it. Iran does not threaten the United States. Unlike Washington\u2019s Arab allies in the region, Iran actually holds reasonably democratic elections and has a Western-oriented, educated, and very young population. Why not open up to Iran with massive amounts of trade and other contacts? Does anyone (except for the neocons) really believe it is better to unleash terrorists on a population than to engage them in trade and travel? We need to worry about blowback from President Trump\u2019s fully-neoconized Middle East policy! That\u2019s the real threat!

FDR and LBJ gave us the modern welfare state and dependent classes automatically voting Democrat; the full bill on the damage they did hasn\u2019t yet been presented. Nixon? A crook and an economic Leftist, who betrayed Taiwan for the People\u2019s Republic; his record certainly isn\u2019t good. Carter? Nothing good can be said about his four years of sanctimony and incompetence. But there is one thing Barack Obama has on all competitors: treason. He showered hundreds of billions of dollars on the Islamic Republic of Iran. There are those who say, \u201cIt was their money. It belonged to the Iranian government but was frozen and not paid since 1979.\u201d Indeed, and there was a reason for that: not even Jimmy Carter, who made the Islamic Republic of Iran possible, thought that money, which had been paid by the Shah\u2019s government in a canceled arms deal, belonged to the mullahs who overthrew the Shah. Likewise Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Clinton, and George W. Bush all thought that the Islamic Republic was not due money that was owed to the Shah. Only Barack Obama did. The definition of treason is giving aid and comfort to the enemy. The leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran order their people to chant \u201cDeath to America\u201d in mosques every Friday, and repeatedly vow that they will ultimately destroy the United States of America and the state of Israel. How was giving them billions and helping them skirt sanctions applied by the U.S. government not treason? Other Presidents have been incompetent, corrupt, dishonest, but which has committed treason on a scale to rival the treason of Barack Obama? The Iranians also operate a global network of jihad terror organizations, one of which, Hizballah, is quite active in Mexico now, with the obvious ultimate intention of crossing the border and committing jihad massacres of Americans. Obama has given a tremendous boost to these initiatives, as well as to Iran\u2019s nuclear program, with his nuclear deal that has given the Iranians hundreds of billions of dollars and essentially a green light to manufacture nuclear weapons, in exchange for absolutely nothing. There is no telling when the worst consequences of Obama\u2019s aid and comfort to the Islamic Republic of Iran will be felt. But they likely will be felt in one way or another. Even as President Trump moves swiftly to restore sanctions and put Iran on notice that its nuclear activity and global adventurism will not be tolerated, those billions cannot be recovered, and the Iranians have already spent a great deal for their jihad cause. However this catastrophe plays out, there is one man who will suffer no consequences whatsoever: Barack Obama. That\u2019s Leftist Privilege. It\u2019s good to be a powerful Leftist in Washington nowadays. Laws? Pah! Laws are for conservatives.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) says he plans to do everything in his power to block President Donald Trump\u2019s nominations to head the State Department and Central Intelligence Agency over war and torture concerns. We told you about Trump\u2019s administration shake-ups and new nominees Tuesday: Following what has appeared for months to be a strained relationship between President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the top diplomat is being replaced. Trump announced Tillerson\u2019s ouster via Twitter Tuesday, saying: \u201cMike Pompeo, Director of the CIA, will become our new Secretary of State. He will do a fantastic job! Thank you to Rex Tillerson for his service! Gina Haspel will become the new Director of the CIA, and the first woman so chosen. Congratulations to all!\u201d This is yet another big shake-up for Trump\u2019s still-young administration \u2014 and it may be the most important one to date. The move creates some big questions about both the administration\u2019s foreign policy ambitions as well as the president\u2019s relationship with the deep state. \u201cI will oppose both Pompeo\u2019s nomination and Haspel\u2019s nomination,\u201d Paul said Wednesday. The Kentucky lawmaker is the first Republican to say he will attempt to block the nominees; but he isn\u2019t the first Republican to express concern. Sen. John McCain of Arizona said Tuesday that he wanted answers about Haspel\u2019s background running CIA torture programs prior to her confirmation. Paul contends that the Trump nominations directly contradict promises the president made on the campaign trail. \u201cI\u2019m perplexed by the nomination of people who love the Iraq War so much that they would advocate for a war with Iran next. I think it goes against most of the things President Trump campaigned on,\u201d he said. The lawmaker added that he can\u2019t support Haspel, whom he described as having expressed \u201cjoyful glee\u201d at being involved in torture programs in the past. \u201cI find it just amazing that anyone would consider having this woman at the head of the CIA,\u201d Paul said. With Paul\u2019s defection and McCain likely to be undergoing treatment for brain cancer at the time of the vote, Trump\u2019s White House will likely be left scurrying for Democrat support to secure the majority necessary for the nominees to be confirmed in the Senate.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

Sinema, a co-founder of the activist group Local to Global Justice, invited people in a now-closed Yahoo group to attend two events with Lynn Stewart, both in 2003.

Pointing out the glaring nature of the smear campaign was the fact that there has been absolutely zero information released about the warrants conducted on officer Amber Guyger, the killer cop who lived just below Jean. \u201cI would love to see more information coming out about the warrants executed on the home of the shooter who lived just below him. I haven\u2019t seen any of those,\u201d said Merritt. Merritt accused the department of conducting a \u201ccommon assassination attempt on the victim that we often see in law enforcement involved shootings.\u201d Sadly, he appears to be correct in his accusations. It is standard procedure for police to dig up dirt on their victims in attempts to smear and assassinate their character to make the killer cops look good in the public eye. Even sadder, however, is the fact that these smear campaigns work most of the time. As the Free Thought Project reported on Wednesday, according to police \u2014 who continue to attempt to spin this story into some tragic mistake \u2014 Guyger accidentally went into the wrong apartment, mistook Jean for an intruder and killed him. \u201cGuyger entered the building and walked down the fourth-floor hallway to what she thought was her apartment,\u201d according to the arrest warrant made public Monday afternoon. \u201cShe inserted a unique door key, with an electronic chip, into the door keyhole. The door, which was slightly ajar prior to Guyger\u2019s arrival, fully opened under the force of the key insertion.\u201d \u201cGuyger drew her firearm, gave verbal commands that were ignored by \u2026 Jean,\u201d according to the warrant. \u201cGuyger fired her handgun two times striking [Jean] in the torso. Guyger entered the apartment, immediately called 911, requesting police and EMS, and provided first aid to \u2026 Jean. \u201cDue to the interior darkness of the apartment, Guyger turned on the interior lights while on the phone with 911. Upon being asked where she was located by emergency dispatchers, Guyger returned to the front door to observe the address and discovered she was at the wrong apartment,\u201d according to the arrest warrant. At no time, according to the warrant, does Guyger say what \u201cverbal commands\u201d she gave. What\u2019s more, any verbal commands she did give were entirely irrelevant as she was the intruder\u2014not Jean. Attempting to imply that Jean was somehow at fault for his own death for disobeying the commands of a homicidal cop who\u2019d just illegally broken into his home is as irresponsible as it is reprehensible. What\u2019s more, according to the attorneys for Jean, when Guyger was on the phone with police, she had to go outside to verify the address of the apartment\u2014implying that she knew she was in the wrong apartment from the start. \u201cFrom the fact that when you look at an affidavit and I\u2019m thinking that I\u2019m at my house and I call 911 because someone was just shot,\u201d Attorney Daryl Washington said. \u201cWell, the very first thing that I\u2019m going to do is I\u2019m not going to go outside and look at my address? I\u2019m going to give them my address right there on the phone. I\u2019m going to say I\u2019m on the phone. My address is this. Why did she have to go outside to verify the address? It makes no sense whatsoever.\u201d Even more ominous than having to verify the address is the fact that according to witnesses, Guyger\u2019s story of inserting the key into Jean\u2019s door and it opening up was simply not true. According to witnesses, Guyger was banging on Jean\u2019s door, demanding he let her in. \u201cIndependent witnesses have already come forward to say that they heard this officer pounding on the door and demanding to be let in,\u201d Lee Merritt, one of the attorneys representing the Jean family, told ABC News. \u201cThe contradictions begin to build from there.\u201d The doors in the complex are also equipped with an automatic closing mechanism.

Paul told CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d and CBS News\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on Sunday that he would do \"whatever it takes,\" including a filibuster, to block the confirmations of Mike Pompeo to head the State Department and Gina Haspel to run the CIA. \u201cYou really want a diplomat to be in charge of the State Department, not someone who is advocating for war,\u201d he told \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cI frankly think that Pompeo\u2019s positions are too much of an advocate for regime change, really everywhere,\u201d he added. \"I don't think our policy ought to be for regime change, so I think Pompeo really isn't a good fit to be a diplomat.\" He's right, too. Pompeo has advocated for regime change in North Korea. We've seen exactly what happens when the US gets involved in such types of regime changes, and the truth is that they really don't work out too well. As for Haspel, Paul told \"Face The Nation,\" \"She oversaw an illegal black ops operation in Thailand that included torture. I don't think torture is what America is about.\" On \"State of the Union,\" Paul added, \"I'll do whatever it takes, and that includes filibuster\" to block their confirmation. \"I don't have the power to stop her nomination,\" he said of Haspel. \"There's enough votes she'll eventually win. Few things in life . . . [are] worth standing up saying 'enough is enough.'\" \"We are not a people that should be so fearful or vengeful that we think that torture is somehow acceptable,\" he added. \"On what level could torture ever be acceptable? We should make a stand on this. She should never lead the CIA.\" Both nominations may face tough confirmation hearings, but it seems that many Americans are just fine with these types of people being in these types of offices. The only thing I can think for that kind of reasoning is that people do not know their Constitution and understand exactly what Senator Paul is trying to warn America about. Instead, people are acting out of emotion and fear. Do I believe we should be concerned about North Korea? Sure, but I'm hardly worried that they will actually attack us. Am I concerned about jihadis? Yep, but I'm not sure I've seen any real hard evidence that torturing them has produced any information that has led to stopping terror attacks. And before you tell me about the media reports and CIA involvement, just keep in mind that a former journalist, who is now dead, told the world that the media lies for the CIA. So, I'm wary of media reports that claim there have been results from the tactics used. Trump has obviously had praise for both Pompeo and Haspel, but then again, his administration has quite a bit of turn over too. Mike Pompeo, Director of the CIA, will become our new Secretary of State. He will do a fantastic job! Thank you to Rex Tillerson for his service! Gina Haspel will become the new Director of the CIA, and the first woman so chosen. Congratulations to all! \u2014 Donald J.

Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren for sending out fundraising emails asking for donations to support their votes against Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh \u2014 even before they cast their votes against him. While voting and then asking supporters to back that decision with cash is common, the watchdog group, the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust (FACT), says asking for money ahead of time crosses the line into vote-buying. FACT asked the Senate ethics committee to probe fundraising emails sent by Ms. Warren, Massachusetts Democrat, and Ms. Harris, California Democrat. Ms. Warren\u2019s email said she was demanding a delay on the judge\u2019s confirmation vote and asked for donations for her 2018 election campaign, while Ms. Harris\u2019s emails detailed several of her actions as a member of the Judiciary Committee, including her questioning of the president\u2019s pick for the high court, and asking for contributions.

Economists are increasingly befuddled at what awaits the once-great U.S. economy. And Wall Street is plainly beginning to panic. Unemployment is a case in point. It now seems obvious that one of those mysterious memos has gone out to the Main Stream Media saying that no-one can mention the immigration moratorium solution. But unemployment is befuddling anyway. Just a few weeks ago professional prognosticators were expecting job growth of 175,000 in May. However, nonfarm payroll growth came in at 54,000 in May, the smallest gain since September, and a fraction of the just lowered consensus forecast (125,000 jobs.) The \"other\" employment survey, of households rather than businesses, also broadcast mixed signals\u2014at least so far as the prospects for native-born workers are concerned. VDARE.com has long argued that the household survey captures the employment of illegal aliens; additionally, it actually mentions ethnicity. In May, according to the Household Survey, total employment rose by 105,000. Non-Hispanics actually gained ground: Total employment: up 105,000 (+0.08 percent) Non-Hispanic employment: up 190,000 (+0.16 percent) Hispanic employment: down 85,000 (-0.42 percent) Thus VDAWDI\u2014VDARE.com's American Worker Displacement Index, unveiled in 2004 and still unique\u2014fell to 126.2 in May from April's 127.0 level. This, of course, is atypical statistical noise. Non-Hispanics have lost jobs at twice the rate of Hispanics since the recession hit in December 2007. And since the official start of the \"recovery\" in June 2009, Hispanics have gained 416,000 jobs while non-Hispanics have lost 675,000 positions. Step back further and the picture is still bleaker. Since January 2001 the number of non-Hispanics holding jobs has declined by 1.9 million, or by -1.6%. Over that same period Hispanic employment rose by 3.9 million, up a whopping 24.2%. Simply put, the 21st century has not been good for non-Hispanic job seekers. This Hispanic/non-Hispanic divide was, of course, a convenient proxy for VDARE.com's primary interest: foreign-born workers and their role in displacing their native-born counterparts. We tracked this by looking at Hispanics because such a high proportion of them are foreign-born\u2014and because the federal government declined to provide data on immigrant vs. non-immigrant unemployment. However, since January 2010, the Bureau of Labor Statistics [BLS] has begun to publish figures for foreign-born and native-born employment. These data are not seasonally adjusted, making month to month trends difficult to interpret. BLS resolves the dilemma by comparing the current month with the same month of the prior year: By this measure also, May 2011 is notable for some catching up on the part of native-born workers\u2014at least when compared to the same month of 2010: Employment Status by Nativity, May 2010-May 2011 (numbers in 1000s; not seasonally adjusted) May-10 May-11 Change % Change Foreign born, 16 years and older Civilian population 35,647 36,348 701 2.0% Civilian labor force 24,210 24,253 43 0.2% Participation rate (%) 67.9% 66.7% -1.2%pt. -1.8% Employed 22,125 22,216 91 0.4% Employment/population % 62.1% 61.1% -1.0%pt. -1.6% Unemployed 2,085 2,037 -48 -2.3% Unemployment rate (%) 8.6% 8.4% -0.2%pt. -2.3% Not in labor force 11,437 12,095 658 5.8% Native born, 16 years and older Civilian population 201,852 202,965 1,113 0.6% Civilian labor force 129,656 129,196 -460 -0.4% Participation rate (%) 64.2% 63.7% -0.5%pt. -0.8% Employed 117,372 117,812 440 0.4% Employment/population % 58.1% 58.0% -0.1%pt. -0.2% Unemployed 12,284 11,384 -900 -7.3% Unemployment rate (%) 9.5% 8.8% -0.7%pt. -7.4% Not in labor force 72,196 73,769 1,573 2.2% Source: BLS, \"The Employment Situation - May 2011,\" June 3, 2011. Table A-7. PDF Thus over the past 12 months: Immigrants and native-born Americans both experienced the same 0.4% job growth, with 440,000 more natives and 91,000 more immigrants at work. A TIE . The immigrant unemployment rate fell by 0.2 points; the native-born rate fell by 0.7 points. ADVANTAGE NATIVE-BORN. The share of immigrants holding jobs fell by 1.6%; the share of natives holding jobs fell by 0.2%. ADVANTAGE NATIVE-BORN . Labor force participation rates fell by 1.2% points for immigrants and 0.8% points for natives. ADVANTAGE NATIVE-BORN . The immigrant population of working age increased by 2.0%; the comparable native population grew by 0.6%. ADVANTAGE IMMIGRANTS By an amazing coincidence, January 2009\u2014the month President Obama took office\u2014is also the earliest month of data published in BLS's new foreign and native-born employment table. Coincidence or not, this means we can piece together the monthly points to see the President's priorities, or at least his practical effect. Setting the job count at 100.0 for both native-born and immigrants in January 2009, immigrant employment ticked up to 102.9 in May\u2014am increase of 2.9%. Native employment ticked down to 97.5\u2014a 2.5% decline. We label this \"The New VDAWDI\". From January 2009 through May 2011 the New VDAWDI, calculated using foreign-born and native-born employment figures, grew by 5.5%. By comparison VDAWDI, calculated using Hispanic and non-Hispanic employment figures, rose by 3.3% over the same period. As we've found before, our older measure of American Worker Displacement understated the problem. In all but a few months of the Obama Administration, native-born workers have lost ground to immigrants Time is running out for native-born workers\u2014a.k.a. Americans.

As of now, the migrant caravan has grown in size to over 4,000 people. \u201cI must, in the strongest of terms, ask Mexico to stop this onslaught \u2013 and if unable to do so I will call up the U.S. Military and CLOSE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER!\u201d Trump wrote of the caravan in a series of tweets on Twitter. \u2026.In addition to stopping all payments to these countries, which seem to have almost no control over their population, I must, in the strongest of terms, ask Mexico to stop this onslaught \u2013 and if unable to do so I will call up the U.S. Military and CLOSE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER!.. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 18, 2018 According to Breitbart, the caravan of migrants that began in Honduras has grown to several thousand people after passing into Guatemala as it heads for the Mexican border. Other Hondurans are leaving the country to join the caravan of illegal immigrants attempting to illegally enter the United States against president Trump\u2019s wishes. I am watching the Democrat Party led (because they want Open Borders and existing weak laws) assault on our country by Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, whose leaders are doing little to stop this large flow of people, INCLUDING MANY CRIMINALS, from entering Mexico to U.S\u2026.. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 18, 2018 Trump also threatened to stop all federal foreign aid payments to Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador if the countries failed to block the flow of illegal immigrants and blamed Democrats for rejecting a reform of immigration laws allowing them to claim asylum. He also claimed that the caravan included criminals. Trump appeared willing to end his new trade deal with Mexico as well if the caravan was not stopped. \u2026.The assault on our country at our Southern Border, including the Criminal elements and DRUGS pouring in, is far more important to me, as President, than Trade or the USMCA. Hopefully Mexico will stop this onslaught at their Northern Border. All Democrats fault for weak laws! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 18, 2018 According to NBC News, the caravan has increased in size to over 4,000. The media outlet also reported that the Mexican government has sent 500 additional federal police to its border with Guatemala in anticipation of their arrival, according to U.S. government documents obtained by NBC News. Part of the caravan, which has split into two groups, is approaching the Mexico-Guatemala border amid a surge in border crossings on the U.S.-Mexico border. In September, U.S. Border Patrol agents apprehended more than 41,400 undocumented immigrants, up from 37,544 in August, according to numbers not yet released publicly but obtained by NBC News.

All they would need to do is download a computer file and use a 3-D printer to stamp out a gun. No background check would weed out felons, those with mental illness, domestic abusers or possible terrorists. No serial number would allow police to trace a weapon used in a crime. And there would be no problem getting past metal detectors with a gun molded from high-quality plastic. Plans by a Texas organization to publish, starting Aug. 1, downloadable blueprints for 3-D-printed plastic firearms \u2014 so-called ghost guns \u2014 have rightly alarmed leading gun safety groups and law enforcement officials. Credit for this dangerous scenario \u2014 in which getting an AR-15-style rifle is just a matter of a few computer clicks \u2014 goes to the Trump administration for its inexplicable decision to settle a lawsuit it was on the verge of winning. The case involves Cody Wilson, founder of Defense Distributed, who sued the government in 2015 after the State Department under the Obama administration made him take down do-it-yourself gunmaking blueprints he had posted online, saying they violated export regulations governing military hardware and technology. Mr. Wilson, an avowed anarchist who hopes for a world in which governments can\u2019t stop individuals from getting guns, claimed his First Amendment right to free speech was being violated. But he lost at every stage of litigation, including a refusal by the Supreme Court to review a decision that the code could not be published during the course of the lawsuit. So it was stunning \u2014 but not surprising, given this administration\u2019s worship at the altar of gun rights \u2014 that the State Department elected last month to quietly settle the case. In addition to signing off on the public release of the 3-D printing tutorials, the State Department also agreed to pay nearly $40,000 of Mr. Wilson\u2019s legal fees. The Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence has filed a Freedom of Information Act request to find out how this senseless decision was reached, and whether groups such as the National Rifle Association were involved. It, along with Everytown for Gun Safety and Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, tried unsuccessfully Friday to get a federal court in Texas to block what it called a \u201ctroubling\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d settlement. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was pressed about the issue Wednesday during his appearance before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. \u201cWhy on earth would the Trump administration make it easier for terrorists and gunmen to produce undetectable plastic guns?\u201d asked Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.). Mr. Pompeo promised to \u201ctake a look at it.\u201d That\u2019s not enough. Ghost guns are already a problem; they are used not just by lone shooters but as part of criminal enterprises. Releasing instructions for their manufacture, which now only circulate on the dark Web, will lead directly to the loss of more innocent lives. The administration should stop the State Department from going ahead with this foolhardy move, and Congress should act to plug the loopholes that these guns are designed to take advantage of.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

            "question": "Which of the following tactics is used in the following text?\n\nArticle: Has Trump Opened the Door? Sagacious gun owners have always known that the ultimate goal of gun control extremists such as Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, Dianne Feinstein, et al., has always been gun confiscation. The plan is not to \u201ccontrol\u201d the private ownership of firearms; it is to PROHIBIT the private ownership of firearms. Enacting ever-encroaching gun control laws is simply an incremental means to the ultimate end of gun confiscation and prohibition. Donald Trump was elected on the promise of protecting the Second Amendment (among other things). Instead, he has become the poster boy for one of the most egregious gun control machinations of all: gun confiscation. As I reported in this column last week, in a bipartisan meeting with congressmen and senators recently, President Trump \u201cvoiced support for confiscating guns from certain individuals deemed to be dangerous, even if it violates due process rights. \u201c\u2018I like taking the guns early, like in this crazy man\u2019s case that just took place in Florida \u2026 to go to court would have taken a long time,\u2019 Trump said at a meeting with lawmakers on school safety and gun violence. \u201c\u2018Take the guns first, go through due process second,\u2019 Trump said. \u201cTrump was responding to comments from Vice President Pence that families and local law enforcement should have more tools to report potentially dangerous individuals with weapons. \u201c\u2018Allow due process so no one\u2019s rights are trampled, but the ability to go to court, obtain an order and then collect not only the firearms but any weapons,\u2019 Pence said. \u201c\u2018Or, Mike, take the firearms first, and then go to court,\u2019 Trump responded.\u201d See the column here: Florida School Massacre Proves Police Are Worthless In Protecting Us Well, Trump\u2019s statements are now the rallying cry for gun grabbers all over America to enact gun confiscation laws. So far, five states have passed \u201cred flag\u201d laws that allow police agencies to confiscate guns from someone deemed to be \u201cdangerous\u201d by either a law enforcement officer or a family member BEFORE the individual has committed any crime, and in one State (Rhode Island) the governor issued an executive order implementing a \u201cred flag\u201d law. Here are the six states where the legislatures have already passed\u2014or the governor has already issued an executive order implementing\u2014\u201cred flag\u201d laws: California Connecticut Indiana Oregon Washington Rhode Island And since Trump\u2019s Stalinist statements, there are at least 24 additional states that are currently considering passing \u201cred flag\u201d laws. These are: Alabama Alaska Arizona Delaware Florida Hawaii Illinois Iowa Kansas Kentucky Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Missouri New Jersey New York North Carolina Ohio Pennsylvania Tennessee Utah Vermont Virginia And it\u2019s not taking long for law enforcement agencies in the above states to begin their Naziesque assault on gun owners. This report is from Seattle:Doubtless, many other states are also considering passing \u201cred flag\u201d laws. \u201cThe city\u2019s police department became the first law enforcement agency in the state to force the surrender of a firearm under a new law known as an \u2018extreme risk protection order.\u2019 \u201cThe incident involves a man who lives in Belltown, who neighbors said had been intimidating people for the past year \u2013 even staring-down customers through store-front windows with a gun holstered at his side. \u201cMental illness is suspected, but that new law allowed police to legally disarm him.\u201d \u201cThe man, who we are not naming, is also well known to the bars and restaurants below his unit along Second Ave. The volume of complaints convinced Seattle police to seek an extreme risk protection order \u2013 or \u2018erpo\u2019 \u2013 which allows law enforcement to legally remove guns from people deemed a danger to themselves or others. \u201cIn this case, the man refused to comply. Because of the new law, police were then able to return with a warrant and force the man to surrender the firearm.\u201d \u201cA few dozen erpos have been served and executed around the state, but Seattle police said they are the only agency so far to seize a gun because the owner refused to hand it over. \u201cLaw enforcement professionals said these specialized protection orders could be a common sense strategy to try and prevent mass shootings \u2013 such as what happened in Parkland, Florida. \u201c\u2018There\u2019s certainly a big concern of the connection between mental health and people exhibiting violent behavior and whether or not they should have access to firearms. The \u201cerpos\u201d give us that tool now as an option,\u2019 said Sgt. Eric Pisconski, who leads the crisis response unit for the Seattle Police Department. \u201cThe confiscations only last a year, although they can be renewed.\u201d See the report here: Seattle Police First In State To Seize Gun Under Mental Health Law A few observations are in order here: First, the open carry of a firearm is LEGAL in the area where this took place. So, the fellow was violating NO gun laws whatsoever. Plus, he never removed the pistol from its holster or brandished it in any way. Secondly, the man was \u201cknown\u201d to nearby bars and restaurants near his place of residence. That means nothing. Known for what? The report doesn\u2019t even say the man was known for acting weirdly or strangely. It just says he was \u201cknown.\u201d And even if he did act weirdly or strangely, if we denied constitutional rights to everyone in that category, a majority of Americans would have no rights, and ALL of Congress would have no rights. Thirdly, what does \u201cvolume of complaints\u201d mean? How many complaints were received over a YEAR\u2019S time? Two? Five? Ten? People complaining about other people happens all of the time. Plus, if complaints had been received over the course of an entire year and police just now decided to act, the man must not have been considered much of a threat. Fourthly, there was NO report of the man \u201cexhibiting violent behavior,\u201d as the police sergeant claims. The report says \u201che had been intimidating people.\u201d How?

I said, \"Mom, when I was in the rock n roll world doing the things that I was doing, nobody said anything, and no one had a problem with what I was doing, that is until I started to emulate (obey) Jesus Christ\" (1 John 2:6). This reminds me of when I gave a prayer at the state capital in Minnesota. After the prayer was over, I had a minister come up to me and tell me that I could not be dropping the \u201cJ\u201d (Jesus) word in the capital. I said that the reason I dropped the \u201cJ\u201d word was because you haven\u2019t in 40 years (Romans 1:16). What of public high schools across the country that we have been going into in order to educate the youth as to who we are, and not what the revisionists and propagandists would have them believe that we are. We have shown the young people that abortion is murder and that 58 million babies have been murdered since 1973 under the guise of woman\u2019s choice (Proverbs 6:17). We got kicked out of a public school for re-enforcing America\u2019s value\u2019s by teaching the US Constitution. We have taught that homosexuality is an abomination, and how it is a felony in every state in our union (Leviticus 18:22; 20:13; Jude 1:7). How true Scripture is when it declares: \u201cWoe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!\" No wonder why the reprobates and hypocrites thought that the Christians who were following the living Christ were turning the world upside down in the book of Acts. They were, in fact, turning the world right side up (Acts 17:6). Identifying the genuine from the counterfeit Last week, I had a woman come up to me at my last meeting in Amery, Wisconsin. She said that she did her research on me and said that the media really attacked me. I responded with, \"Of course they did, and of course they still do.\" They are being exposed for who they are and they do not like it. (John 15:22). I told her that there are too many counterfeits, self-proclaimed leaders, out there who care more about saving face, than they do the souls of men (Luke 19:10), as well as saving their country. Apparently they have a reputation to keep up. Philippians 2:7-9 These are those that sit behind the status of some sort of church or political leader of the pack. Yet, you do not see any warfare or opposition around them and why? because they have simply forsaken the cross. There is no absolutes with these people. They are people pleasers and nothing more. After all you can always tell what a man stands for by the enemies that he has. They hide behind a microphone day after day. Yet, they fail to confront the issues that needed to be confronted. The reason they don't is because they are guilty of what they fail to confront! They are paper tigers. They can write all big and bad but when it comes to what someone else should do. However, when it is time for them to put boots on the ground, they are simply missing in action (MIA). These are willing to live in the freest country in the world as long as it is not them that have to sacrifice to maintain it. There is also a group of people out there that have to be friends with everyone (and have to apologize to any that they may have told the truth lest they should convict them unto godly repentance (2 Corinthians 7:10) as they congregate week after week deceiving themselves into believing that they are demanding a lawful change just as long as it does not offend anyone (Matthew 5:10). As a matter of fact, these counterfeits will be the first ones to get angry with and denounce and attack the ones that are sent by the Spirit of God (Galatians 4:29). Maybe this group of people should ask their enemies for instructions as to how change is brought about, and in a righteous sense reverse the lawlessness-taking place in this country (Matthew 24:12).

Eight US states and the District of Columbia have argued in court that the blueprints available online to make untraceable, undetectable plastic weapons like this single-shot \"Liberator\" handgun could fall into the wrong hands Cody Wilson's Texas-based company Defense Distributed had briefly made the blueprints available online, but Seattle-based US District Judge Robert Lasnik granted an injunction Tuesday to take the material down. The Donald Trump administration last month gave permission for Wilson to publish the blueprints, but the White House said Wednesday the president was unaware of the decision and was glad it was being reviewed. Eight US states and the District of Columbia sued, arguing the blueprints could allow anyone -- from a teen to a 'lone wolf' gunman -- to make untraceable, undetectable plastic weapons. Wilson complied with the judge's order, but put out a call for financial support for the legal battle ahead, including a scheduled August 10 court hearing. He told CBS News ahead of the injunction that he believes \"access to firearms is a fundamental human dignity. It's a fundamental human right.\" \"What I'm doing is legally protected,\" he said. \"I will go to the appellate level. I will go to the Supreme Court. I will waste all my time.\" - President 'glad' for review - As uproar was building Tuesday over Wilson's efforts, the president tweeted that making plastic 3D-printed guns publicly available \"doesn't seem to make much sense.\" White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders elaborated Wednesday, saying the administration's Justice Department had acted on its own in granting Wilson permission to publish the blueprints on his Defcad website -- settling a five-year legal battle. \"The Department of Justice made a deal without the president's approval,\" Sanders said. \"The president's glad this effort was delayed to give more time to review the issue.\" Sanders also repeated the administration's claim from a day earlier that existing law already prohibits plastic firearms. The National Rifle Association, the nation's most politically influential gun rights group, echoed that claim, contending that the 1988 law made the current 3D-printed gun issue moot. \"Regardless of what a person may be able to publish on the Internet, undetectable plastic guns have been illegal for 30 years,\" the NRA said in a statement. But Wilson has gotten around the legal prohibition by providing instructions with the digital files for 3D printing his \"Liberator\" plastic gun that call for an approximately six-ounce block of steel to be affixed to the weapon. Should those who print the gun follow those instructions, metal detectors would pick up the weapons, thus complying with the law. But while users can build the gun, there is no way to ensure they affix metal to it. - 'The debate is over' - Late Tuesday, dozens of Democratic senators introduced legislation to prohibit the publication of 3D-printable firearm designs, a move gun control groups applauded. But some damage was already done. Wilson's blueprints had been posted on Defcad before the court order took effect and had already been downloaded thousands of times. \"The debate is over. The guns are downloadable. The files are in the public domain -- you cannot take them back,\" Wilson told CBS. Gun control groups nevertheless were relieved by the judge's decision, with the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence calling 3D-printed firearms \"nothing short of a menace to society.\" \"There is simply no way of telling how much damage has already been done by Cody Wilson's dangerous and reckless actions,\" Brady Campaign co-president Kris Brown said in a statement. \"This is a strong step and a clear victory for the entire gun safety movement, but we simply can't let up.\" Prior to last month, Wilson had actually been losing his drawn-out legal battle, after both a federal district court and an appellate court ruled against him. The US Supreme Court declined to take up his case. But in a sign of his determination to continue the legal fight, a message on the Defense Distributed website made a public appeal for financial support \"to uncensor the site.\"\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

The outbreak, declared by the DRC health ministry on Tuesday, is the DRC\u2019s ninth known outbreak of Ebola since 1976,when the deadly viral disease was first identified in then-Zaire by a Belgian-led team. Scientists are greatly concerned that this outbreak in the remote Bikoro region will travel 175 miles to the city of Mbandaka \u2013 the capital of Equateur province and home to around 1.2 million residents. We\u2019ve updated this map. Turns out that the provincial capital of Equateur, Mbandaka, is home to roughly 1M people.

When a small outbreak hit the DRC last year, eight people were infected and four died. In 2014, 66 were infected out of which 49 died \u2013 a 74% fatality rate. In the 2002-2003 outbreak, 90% of those infected died. That said, on average the disease kills around half of those who contract it. Ebola, a haemorrhagic fever, killed at least 11,000 across the world after it decimated West Africa and spread rapidly over the space of two years. The pandemic was officially declared over back in January 2016, when Liberia was announced to be Ebola-free by the WHO. The country, rocked by back-to-back civil wars that ended in 2003, was hit the hardest by the fever, with 40 per cent of the deaths having occurred there. Sierra Leone reported the highest number of Ebola cases, with nearly of all those infected having been residents of the nation. -Daily Mail Experts say the DRC\u2019s vast, remote terrain provides an advantage, as outbreaks often remain localized and easy to isolate. Bikoro, however, is not far from the Congo river \u2013 an essential waterway used for transport and commerce. Downstream lies Kinshasa and Brazzaville \u2013 the DRC\u2019s capital. The two cities are home to a combined 12 million people. As such, neighboring countries are on high alert. Officials in Nigeria, Guinea and Gambia have incresaed screening measures along their airports and borders, measures which helped contain the virus during the West African epidemic that began in 2013. Angola, Zambia, Tanzania, Uganda, South Sudan, Central African Republic, Rwanda, Burundi and the Republic of Congo \u2013 which border the DRC \u2013 have all been alerted. While Kenya, which does not border the country, has issued warnings over the possible spread of Ebola. Thermal guns to detect anyone with a fever have been put in place along its border with Uganda and at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. Concerned health officials in Nigeria, which also does not border the DRC, have put similar measures in place to keep its population safe. -Daily Mail Scientists believe Ebola is most often passed to humans by fruit bats, however porcupines, gorillas, antelope and chimpanzees could also be carriers. It is transmitted between humans through blood, secretions and other bodily fluids (and surfaces) of those infected.

And that's due to the hard work of committed conservative journalists who stayed on this story, especially at the Daily Caller, which got the Rep. Davis quotes, twice. Some credit also goes to Jake Tapper at CNN and Glenn Kessler at the Washington Post for a willingness to discuss the subject even when their media outlets didn't want to. The debate over the ties between Women's March leaders and Farrakhan made into a debate on the View. And that debate involved none other than Valerie Jarrett. The New York Times has now run its own explainer piece on Farrakhan and the Dems which mentions the infamous Obama-Farrakhan photo. There's also a quote from an Obama spokeswoman claiming that, \u201cPresident Obama has denounced racism and anti-Semitism his entire life. That includes his public and repeated repudiations of Louis Farrakhan\u2019s views over the years. Today is no different \u2013 he still rejects the harmful and divisive views Farrakhan continues to espouse.\u201d That fails to explain why he met with him. And maybe one of these days someone will ask him that question. And then Obama can give a new remix of his Wright speech. \"I can no more disavow Calypso Louie than I can my dead white grandmother.\" Rep. Danny Davis, after defending Farrakhan, now has a statement condemning him. But we've seen that before. So it likely doesn't represent his views. After a previous statement, Rep. Davis made an infamous comment about the \"Jewish question\". So it probably still isn't over. The statement though is full of conspiracy theories and blames everyone else for Davis' behavior except him. And now on to \"civil rights hero\" (TM) Rep. Clyburn. South Carolina Rep. James Clyburn attended a 2011 event with Farrakhan and shared the stage with him, even after Jewish groups voiced their opposition to Clyburn attending the event. Clyburn told the Final Call, a Nation of Islam publication, that he was \u201cnot bothered in the least bit\u201d by criticisms of his attendance at the event. As the assistant Democratic leader, Clyburn is the third-highest ranked Democrat in the House. He declined to condemn Farrakhan in a statement released to The Daily Caller News Foundation on Thursday. \u201cI have fought all my life to advance the cause of social justice and equality, and I have always opposed bigotry in all its forms,\u201d Clyburn said in the statement. His office declined repeated inquiries regarding whether the congressman is willing to condemn Farrakhan, and whether he stood by his decision in 2011 to shrug off criticisms of Farrakhan. Clyburn is now the eighth House Democrat to have direct ties to Farrakhan. The Republican Jewish Coalition has already called on the seven other Democrats to resign over their ties to Farrakhan. Obviously not going to happen. But the story is breaking through the embargo.

Pic: NASA NASA has released a record-breaking photograph taken by the New Horizons spacecraft when it was 3.79 billion miles away from the Earth. New Horizons flew past Pluto in July 2015, taking pictures which revealed an even more diverse landscape than scientists had previously imagined. After the fly-by, the spacecraft continued into the Kuiper Belt - similar to the asteroid belt but further out from the Sun and composed of dwarf planets and frozen ice, rather than rocky bodies. Now, using its Long Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI), the spacecraft has photographed several Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs) and dwarf planets at unique angles. \u00a9 Other A zoomed-in version of the 'Pale Blue Dot' image The false-colour images released by NASA are the farthest from Earth ever captured by a spacecraft, and are also the closest-ever images of Kuiper Belt objects. New Horizons was even further away from Earth than the Voyager 1 space probe when it turned towards the Earth on 14 February 1990 and took a picture of a tiny dot. In 1994, US astronomer Carl Sagan reflected on the significance of the photograph to an audience at Cornell University, famously coining its name as the \"Pale Blue Dot\", and giving one of the most widely published speeches of all time. \u00a9 Getty Carl Sagan and the 'Pale Blue Dot' photograph New Horizons is only the fifth man-made spacecraft to ever travel beyond the outer planets, and many of its activities are setting distance records, according to NASA. In December it successfully carried out the most-distant course-correction manoeuvre ever, with the mission team guiding it towards a close-encounter with a KBO scheduled for 1 January 2019. \"That New Year's flight past MU69 will be the farthest planetary encounter in history, happening one billion miles beyond the Pluto system - which New Horizons famously explored in July 2015,\" said NASA. Fortunately, the spacecraft is healthy and functioning properly, although it is currently in hibernation. The mission controllers at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, will bring the spacecraft out of its electronic slumber in June to begin a series of system checkouts and other activities to prepare it for the next record-breaking encounter.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

Even more eleventh-hour character-assassination attempts may be coming given the enraged Left\u2019s determination to prevent the judge\u2019s ascent to the Supreme Court at all costs. Whether the claims are true is irrelevant to these people. Only the seriousness and luridness of the charges matter as they get aired over and over again in the 24-hour news cycle. They don\u2019t care about the victims they create. Only the headlines. The new allegations surfaced yesterday as the Senate Judiciary Committee battens down the hatches for a hearing today to receive oral evidence from the first accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, 51, who claims Kavanaugh, 53, tried to rape her decades ago when he was a high school student. The third accuser is Julie Swetnick, a 55-year-old certified systems engineer, who on Wednesday claimed that in the early 1980s Kavanaugh and others spiked the drinks of young women at high school parties with intoxicants to clear the way for them to be gang-raped. Incredibly, Swetnick said in a sworn statement that she witnessed gang rapes at these parties but kept on attending them anyway. It gets weirder. Kavanaugh was a \u201cmean drunk,\u201d she stated. He drank excessively at these parties and would grind against girls and try to take their clothing of, she said. Swetnick claimed to have been gang-raped at one of these parties in 1982 as a result of consuming a spiked drink that contained \u201cQuaaludes or something similar.\u201d Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge were present at the party at which she was raped, she states, but she doesn\u2019t accuse them of participating in it. In response, Kavanaugh labeled Swetnick's salacious allegations \"ridiculous and from the Twilight Zone.\" \"I don't know who this is and this never happened,\" the judicial nominee added. A CNBC summary describes Swetnick: A 1980 graduate of Gaithersburg High School in Maryland, she said she has held multiple clearances for work done at the Treasury Department, U.S. Mint, IRS, State Department and Justice Department, among other government agencies. Swetnick says in her affidavit that she saw Kavanaugh in the early 1980s \"drink excessively at many\" house parties in suburban Maryland. At the time, Kavanaugh and Judge were students at Georgetown Prep, a private Catholic all-boys school. She said Kavanaugh and Judge engaged in \"abusive and physically aggressive behavior toward girls,\" which \"included the fondling and groping of girls without their consent\" and \"not taking 'No' for an answer.\" Predictably, all 10 Democrat members of the Judiciary Committee urged President Trump to either \"immediately withdraw the nomination or order an FBI investigation into all the allegations.\" There is no indication so far that the president will oblige them. To no one\u2019s surprise, Trump\u2019s legal tormentor, Stormy Daniels attorney Michael Avenatti, whom Tucker Carlson has dubbed \u201ccreepy porn lawyer,\u201d is representing Swetnick. \"There should be an immediate investigation\" of Swetnick\u2019s dramatic allegations, Avenatti said on MSNBC, \"and there should be no rush to confirm him to the U.S. Supreme Court.\" The president slammed Avenatti. \u201cAvenatti is a third rate lawyer who is good at making false accusations, like he did on me and like he is now doing on Judge Brett Kavanaugh[,]\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter. \u201cHe is just looking for attention and doesn\u2019t want people to look at his past record and relationships - a total low-life!\u201d He rejected Swetnick\u2019s allegations as \u201canother beauty\u201d and described Avenatti as a \u201ccon artist.\u201d \u201cAll of a sudden, the hearings are over, and the rumors start coming out,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd then you this other con artist, Avenatti, come out with another beauty today.\" A fourth accuser popped up yesterday, Politico reports. According to an interview transcript released Wednesday night by the Senate Judiciary Committee: An anonymous woman wrote to Sen. Cory Gardner\u2019s (R-Colo.) office on Sept. 22 alleging that the Supreme Court nominee shoved another woman \u201cup against the wall very aggressively and sexually\u201d in 1998 after leaving a bar where both had been drinking, the transcript states. Kavanaugh denied any involvement in the events alleged in that complaint, which was first reported by NBC. Depending on how you do the counting, there may even be a fifth and sixth accusation against Kavanaugh. The newspaper account continues: The transcript of Kavanaugh's Tuesday interview also cited another anonymous claim of sexual misconduct involving Kavanaugh, dating back to 1985 and sent to the office of Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), which the judge also flatly denied to investigators. And GOP investigators said late Wednesday they received an additional anonymous claim of rape passed along by Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.). Accuser number two is Deborah Ramirez, 53, who went public with her claims in a New Yorker magazine article Sunday. Ramirez alleges she was assaulted by Kavanaugh at a drunken party decades ago at Yale College. She claims Kavanaugh exposed himself to her and brushed his genitals against her. If Kavanaugh isn\u2019t on the bench Monday, the Supreme Court will be shorthanded as it begins hearing cases in its new term. It normally has a complement of nine justices but with Anthony Kennedy\u2019s retirement July 31, which cleared the way for Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination, there have been only eight justices. Roughly speaking there is a 4-to-4 liberal to conservative ideological split on the court. Democrats are trying to drag the confirmation process into the next Congress where they may seize control from Republicans. Election Day is November 6. The GOP currently controls the Senate, which has the final say on judicial nominations, by an uncomfortably close margin of 51 to 49. The proceedings Thursday are supposed to get underway at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time.

They have resorted to peddling an allegation of sexual misconduct against Judge Kavanaugh that supposedly occurred while the judge was in high school. The accuser had refused to identify herself before and during the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings. She conveniently waited until this Sunday to come forward via an on-the-record interview with the Washington Post. The accuser\u2019s name is Christine Blasey Ford, a registered Democrat who is currently a California professor teaching clinical psychology. Judge Kavanaugh issued a statement on Friday in which he said, \"I categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation. I did not do this back in high school or at any time.\" Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee that heard Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s public testimony earlier this month during his Supreme Court confirmation hearing, had received last July a copy of a letter written by the woman making the charge, who we now know was Ms. Ford. Even though Senator Feinstein had the letter in hand, she never brought up the charge during the public hearing, nor during her own meeting with the judge. Instead, Senator Feinstein sat on the letter until late last week, when she issued a cryptic release stating that she had received the letter but did not want to give more details in deference to the woman\u2019s wish to keep the matter confidential. Senator Feinstein turned the letter over to the FBI. The FBI placed the letter in its background file on Judge Kavanaugh but decided not to pursue any further investigation. Senator Feinstein had initially resisted sharing the contents of the letter with her fellow Democrat members of the Senate Judiciary Committee or to go public with its existence because \u201cthe incident was too distant in the past to merit public discussion\u201d and she had already \u201ctaken care of it,\u201d according to a source quoted by The New Yorker. Nevertheless, Senator Feinstein evidently bowed to pressure from her leftist colleagues to find a way to insert the allegation into the cesspool of public gossip at the eleventh hour. The New Yorker article, written before Ms. Ford publicly identified herself, provided some details regarding her allegation. However, now Ms. Ford has decided to do what she called her \u201ccivic responsibility\u201d and tell her own story publicly. How convenient, coming just 4 days before the scheduled Senate Judiciary Committee vote! The whole sequence of events surrounding how this allegation has suddenly come to light reeks of a set-up, reminiscent of how Anita Hill surfaced in a last-minute attempt to derail Justice Clarence Thomas's Supreme Court confirmation. Christine Blasey Ford claims, according to the Washington Post article, that \u201cone summer in the early 1980s, Kavanaugh and a friend \u2014 both \u2018stumbling drunk,\u2019 Ford alleges \u2014 corralled her into a bedroom during a gathering of teenagers at a house in Montgomery County. While his friend watched, she said, Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed on her back and groped her over her clothes, grinding his body against hers and clumsily attempting to pull off her one-piece bathing suit and the clothing she wore over it. When she tried to scream, she said, he put his hand over her mouth. \u2018I thought he might inadvertently kill me,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018He was trying to attack me and remove my clothing.\u2019\u201d Ms. Ford said she was able to escape the room and go home without any apparent further incident after \u201cKavanaugh\u2019s friend and classmate at Georgetown Preparatory School, Mark Judge, jumped on top of them, sending all three tumbling.\u201d Here is where Ms. Ford\u2019s story becomes quite murky and begins to fall apart. Although Ms. Ford believes the alleged incident occurred during the summer of 1982, she \u201csaid she does not remember some key details of the incident,\u201d according to the Washington Post article. For example, Ms. Ford \u201csaid she does not remember how the gathering came together the night of the incident.\u201d She also does not remember how she got home. Yet she claims to be absolutely certain that Kavanaugh, whom she presumably knew only as an acquaintance and said she had not spoken to since the night the incident allegedly occurred, was involved in the alleged incident. Ms. Ford admitted that she \u201ctold no one at the time what had happened to her.\u201d In fact, she said she recalled thinking: \u201cI\u2019m not ever telling anyone this. This is nothing, it didn\u2019t happen, and he didn\u2019t rape me.\u201d Even if one explains this behavior as the natural reaction of a frightened teenager to a highly traumatic incident, that does not explain why, by her own admission, she \u201ctold no one of the incident in any detail until 2012, when she was in couples therapy with her husband,\u201d according to the Washington Post article. Most revealingly, the article reported on a gaping hole in the therapist\u2019s notes, portions of which were provided by Ms. Ford for the Washington Post\u2019s review. The therapist\u2019s notes \u201cdo not mention Kavanaugh\u2019s name but say she reported that she was attacked by students \u2018from an elitist boys\u2019 school\u2019 who went on to become \u2018highly respected and high-ranking members of society in Washington.\u2019\u201d In other words, the only written documentation Ms. Ford has offered in support of her allegation about the incident she said took place while she was in high school \u2013 a therapist\u2019s notes of a couples therapy session occurring 30 years after the alleged incident \u2013 did not mention Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s name.

Fisher is rightly incensed by Bergoglio\u2019s cunning response, \u201cI will not say a single word on this , \u201d concerning Archbishop Vigan\u00f2\u2019s damning indictment of Bergoglio\u2019s rehabilitation of the monster once known as Cardinal McCarrick for some five years before adverse worldwide press coverage forced to him to punish that serial homosexual rapist of whose crimes Vigan\u00f2 had personally informed him back in 2013\u2014information of which Bergoglio was clearly already aware at that time, as Vigan\u00f2 testifies. I never thought I\u2019d see the day when a preening, Internet-created neo-Catholic doyenne such as Simcha Fisher, as notorious as Mark Shea for her crude and often unprintable invective against traditionalists, would unload on Pope Bergoglio with the following headline: \u201cDoes Francis know he sounds like an abuser?\u201d The scales have fallen from Fisher\u2019s eyes and now, at last, she sees Bergoglio, however grudgingly, for what he is: a power-mad ecclesiastical tyrant. (A tyrant, moreover, who has ascended to the papacy in a manner reminiscent of the ascension of the corrupt Benedict IX, another \u201cdisgrace to the Chair of Peter,\u201d following the machinations of a Roman cabal, as I discuss below.) Quoth Fisher: I have a number of friends who have escaped abusive marriages. They tell me that Pope Francis is sounding more and more like the men who abused them. He\u2019s sounding like the men who hid that abuse from the world, who taught their victims to blame themselves, who used spiritual pressure to persuade them and their families that it would actually be wrong, sinful, to defend themselves. Just listen to him. After responding to a question about Vigano\u2019s very serious accusations, he said point blank, \u201cI will not say a single word on this.\u201d\u2026 [F]or the rest of the week and more, he kept up an unmistakable theme of calling for silence, equating silence with holiness, and painting himself as a Christlike victim in his silence. Then he says it\u2019s \u201cugly\u201d to accuse others of sinning. Then he suggests that healing and reconciliation will only come if we take a hard look at our own flaws\u2026. To the victims of the Church, and to those who love them, it sounds like he is saying, \u201cWho do you think you are? I don\u2019t have to explain myself to you. You\u2019re the guilty one. You brought this on yourself. If you want to be loved, then know your place. I\u2019m the victim, here, not you. If you know what\u2019s good for you, keep your mouth shut.\u201d This is how abusers talk. They\u2019re not content with power; they have to keep their victims doubting and blaming themselves constantly, so they don\u2019t become a threat. Whether Francis knows it or not, this is how he sounds. We can overlook the fig leaf \u201cwhether Francis knows it or not\u2026\u201d. Fisher knows that Francis knows it, even if she still cannot bring herself to say explicitly what should now be apparent to the entire body of the faithful: that Bergoglio\u2019s very presence on the Chair of Peter is a grave threat to the common good of the Church and the integrity of the Faith. Click below to Subscribe to The Remnant's YouTube channel! Yet Fisher maintains a sliver of space for deniability in order to maintain that indispensable distinction between her and those loathsome traditionalists: \u201cI don\u2019t have any ideological reason to want to bring him down. I have defended him as long as I could, up until the Chile debacle. And so I am working as hard as I can not to assume the worst, not to believe that this man who promised so much fresh air is really so intent on slamming doors shut before we find out even worse things hidden inside. But he is not making it easy. I am not saying he is an abuser. But he sounds like one.\u201d That is, Fisher was not concerned about Bergoglio\u2019s relentless assault on traditional Catholic teaching and practice\u2014to her, opposition to Francis on that account is just \u201cideology\u201d\u2014but only his role in covering up sexual abuse by bishops and priests. But why is Fisher still \u201cworking hard not to assume the worst\u201d when there is no longer anything to assume as the ever-mounting evidence of malintent has been in plain view for years? Indeed, why else did Archbishop Vigan\u00f2 risk everything in order to expose this Pope, even to the extent of revealing matters supposedly within the scope of \u201cthe Pontifical secret\u201d? On orders of the Vatican Secretary of State, the Vatican secret police are reportedly scouring the globe in search of Vigan\u00f2, who has gone into hiding, \u201cin order to prevent more unpredictable damage to the image of Pope Francis and the Holy See on the world stage, but also to \u2018prepare the terrain\u2019 for the former apostolic nuncio-turned-whistleblower to be prosecuted\u201d under canon law. The Dictator Pope must destroy his most potent critic thus far. Everything depends on it! But it may already be too late to save a regime whose only defense is not truth but raw power. At last count, some 29 bishops have publicly declared Vigan\u00f2\u2019s allegations against Bergoglio credible and worthy of investigation. Now even the distinguished canonist Edward Peters, who is no less than a Referendary of the Apostolic Signatura appointed by Pope Benedict XVI, declares that if Vigan\u00f2\u2019s allegations are true then Bergoglio must go: Of what was said above concerning resignation from Church office in general, what would not apply to a pope, of all office holders, if he, as alleged by Vigan\u00f2, from the first months of his papacy knowingly protected and favored a cardinal who was [pick a disgusting verb]-ing seminarians? By what possible stretch of the imagination would such an occupant be suited for the Chair of Peter?

Rich Penkoski, the father of a Mountain Ridge student, contacted me and explained the situation further. He sent me the packets the school gave out for the Jewish and the Christian lessons and commented: Notice no bible verses, no reciting the 10 commandments or the Lord\u2019s prayer. No practicing writing in Hebrew (not even the 10 commandments) as compared to the Islamic packet. There are no statements of faith, nothing asking the students to write it or practice in any of the Jewish or Christian rituals. Furthermore the principal of Mountain Ridge Middle School Dr. Branch has used my words against me by saying the teacher did tell the students about the Lord\u2019s prayer (my daughter as well as 1 other said this is false)[.] He is using my arguments I made to him yesterday to protect the teacher. The teacher today told the students the assignment was optional. My daughter as well as other students were under the impression all the packet assignments were mandatory (the Jewish one and the Christian ones were mandatory). I wrote to Dr. Branch to share with him the resource that Miss Hinson used and point out that the material she gave the students did not include all the faith aspects for Christianity. The students received 2 pages for Christianity from this resource while all the Islamic sections were left intact. Here\u2019s the link for you to review. You will notice all the faith elements were left out for Judaism and Christianity while the Islamic section was left the way it\u2019s presented. https://www.gvsd.org/cms/lib/PA01001045/Centricity/Domain/610/World%20Religions.pdf So she decided to use the extra resources for Islam and the school is saying that\u2019s not indoctrination or proselytizing? The faith aspects and the same considerations were not given to the others as they were for Islam. This actually further proves my point that Islam was afforded special privilege over the others. The school is backtracking and being deceptive to try and weasel out of this. The teacher today clarified things for the students but that still does not excuse the fact that they are teaching the Islamic faith and asking the kids to participate in Sharia. Look at the Islamic packet again. They are asking the kids to write the beginning of Surahs. The teacher still has not corrected the error that calligraphy was started by the arabs. They are doubling down and only after being called on it are they trying to backtrack. Rich Penkoski is hardly the first to protest this egregious submission to the most vicious and brutal ideology on the face of the Earth. In Volusia County, Florida, hundreds protested Islamic lessons in their \u201cWorld History\u201d text, a Common Core-approved high school history textbook. With an entire chapter dedicated to the virtues of Islam and not a single chapter for Christianity, the textbook had Floridians in a frenzy. And who is the biggest pusher of Common Core besides leftist progressives? The Islamic Society of North America, a Muslim Brotherhood front group, along with the Hamas-tied Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR). In Florida, CAIR is on the offensive (more here). We have seen the increasing Islamization of the public-school curriculum. History lessons in Islam are dawah \u2013 proselytizing for Islam. Large public-school publishers have been bought by the Saudis. In West Virginia, it gets even worse. Rich Penkoski has alerted me to the latest development in the forced Islamization of his children\u2019s school curriculum: after the Daily Caller and Geller Report exposed what was happening, Mountain Ridge administrators and teachers began messaging parents who were sharing the story, asking them to remove their posts. What do they have to hide? Apparently, a great deal. Worse still, Penkoski is now being threatened by students who attend the school with his daughter. (And who is behind them?

It is the response of the military/security complex to Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign statement that he intended to normalize relations with Russia. Trump recognized that the extreme Russiaphobia, which the hegemonic neoconservatives had whipped up since Vladimir Putin\u2019s statement at the Munich Security Conference in 2007 that Russia was a sovereign country and intended to act like one, was a threat to life on earth. The neoconservatives, who have controlled US foreign policy since the Clinton regime, are unwilling to accept limitations by any other country on Washington\u2019s ability to act unilaterally. When Putin blocked the Obama regime\u2019s invasion of Syria and bombing of Iran, the neoconservatives paid Putin back by using NGOs and Ukranian politicians financed by Washington to overthrow the democratically elected government of Ukraine and to put in office a government hostile to Russia. The intent was to use Ukraine, a Russian province for more than three centuries, to create problems for Russia that would absorb Russia\u2019s attention and return a free hand to Washington and Israel in the Middle East and also to evict Russia from its Black Sea naval base in Crimea. When Crimeans voted to reunite with Russia, Washington misrepresented the democratic result of self-determination as a \u201cRussian invasion and annexation of Crimea.\u201d Such an extraordinary misrepresentation destroyed any remaining confidence the Russian government might have had in Washington\u2019s veracity.

As I and Stephen Cohen have emphasized, the danger of nuclear war is today far higher than ever during the long Cold War as there is today no trust whatsoever between the two governments. Donald Trump is totally correct that nuclear war would be a terminable event and that nothing is more important than restoring a cooperative and mutually respectful relationship between the US and Russia. The problem is that the military/security complex sees it differently. After 70 years of entrenchment the military/security complex is an independent political force. President Eisenhower warned the American people about this likely outcome in 1961 to no avail. From the standpoint of the military/security complex, the problem of normalizing relations with Russia is that it downgrades the \u201cRussian threat\u201d that is so essential to the $1,000 billion annual budget of the military/security complex and the power that such a massive budget conveys. Only 16 countries in the world out of 195 countries have a GDP greater than $1,000 billion. The military/security complex is large enough to be a member of the G-20 and to have its own currency and military. Obama\u2019s CIA director, John Brennan, quickly organized the Russiagate conspiracy against Trump. Comey, Rosenstein, Clapper, Mueller, McCabe, Peter Strzok and others were, and are, apparently implicated as active participants in orchestrating an alleged collusion between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin to steal the US presidential election. Based on deception of the FISA Court, warrants were illegally obtained that became the basis for appointing Mueller as a special prosecutor to construct by whatever means possible a case against President Trump. After two years the only evidence we have of Russiagate is that it is a conspiracy against President Trump and the American people. Indeed, Mueller, fully aware that there was no Trump-Putin conspiracy, has not bothered to look for any evidence as there can be no evidence of something that did not happen. He pulled out of a hat some phony and meaningless indictments of some Russians in order to make it look like there was a conspiracy without having to prove it, but his main focus has been on framing Paul Manafort. Mueller\u2019s investigation of Manafort has nothing to do with the Russiagate story line. Manafort\u2019s alleged crimes are far outside Mueller\u2019s mandate and took place, if they did, years before the alleged events of Russiagate. Manafort\u2019s conviction by a jury on 8 of the 18 counts is being misrepresented by the Trump-hating presstitutes as vindication of the Russiagate investigation and as \u201cA dark day for Trump,\u201d with the presstitutes suggesting a Watergate parallel that will force Trump from office. Manafort was found guilty not of Russiagate, but of income tax evasion and misrepresenting his financial position on a loan application. We do not know if Manafort is guilty or is simply a victim of Mueller\u2019s frameup and an incompetent jury. American juries are notoriously incompetent, which is why 97% of felony indictments are settled with a plea bargain. Even the innocent had rather work out a plea arrangement and admit to something that they did not do than to face an insouciant American jury. Remember the jury that condemned the survivors of the FBI\u2019s massacre of the Branch Davidians in Waco, Texas, to be locked away for many years so that they could not talk and tell of the mass murder inflicted on a religious group by the FBI. It is unclear how much of a crime it can be to misrepresent your financial position on a loan application when one of the causes of the mortgage-backed derivative crisis was the misrepresentation of mortgage applicants on the loan documents by the companies issuing the mortgages. Instead of prosecution, Washington relied on the Federal Reserve to bail out the banks holding the misrepresented loans.

Donald Trump has delivered on these as well as any president since Reagan. The failures that killed the Bush party, and that represented departures from Reaganite traditionalism and conservatism, are: First, the hubristic drive, despite the warnings of statesmen like George Kennan, to exploit our Cold War victory and pursue a policy of permanent containment of a Russia that had lost a third of its territory and half its people. We moved NATO into Eastern Europe and the Baltic, onto her doorstep. We abrogated the ABM treaty Nixon had negotiated and moved defensive missiles into Poland. John McCain pushed to bring Ukraine and Georgia into NATO, and even to send U.S. forces to face off against Russian troops. Thus we got a second Cold War that need never have begun and that our allies seem content to let us fight alone. Europe today is not afraid of Vladimir Putin reaching the Rhine. Europe is afraid of Africa and the Middle East reaching the Danube. Let the Americans, who relish playing empire, pay for NATO. Second, in a reflexive response to 9/11, we invaded Afghanistan and Iraq, dumped over the regime in Libya, armed rebels to overthrow Bashar Assad in Syria, and backed Saudi intervention in a Yemeni civil war, creating a humanitarian crisis in that poorest of Arab countries that is exceeded in horrors only by the Syrian civil war.

Why are the people responsible for these wars still being listened to, rather than confessing their sins at second-thoughts conferences?

As every false accusation has fallen away, every bogus smear shown to be the work of political enemies, Julian stands vindicated as one who has exposed a system that threatens humanity. The Collateral Damage video, the war logs of Afghanistan and Iraq, the Cablegate revelations, the Venezuela revelations, the Podesta email revelations \u2026 these are just a few of the storms of raw truth that have blown through the capitals of rapacious power. The fakery of Russia-gate, the collusion of a corrupt media and the shame of a legal system that pursues truth-tellers have not been able to hold back the raw truth of WikiLeaks revelations. They have not won, not yet, and they have not destroyed the man. Only the silence of good people will allow them to win. Julian Assange has never been more isolated. He needs your support and your voice. Now more than ever is the time to demand justice and free speech for Julian. Thank you.\u201d No Place to Hide: Edwa... Glenn Greenwald Best Price: $1.49 Buy New $3.70 (as of 06:30 EDT - Details) Dennis Bernstein: We continue our discussion of the case of Julian Assange, now in the Ecuadorian embassy in Great Britain. John Pilger, it is great to talk to you again. But it is a profound tragedy, John, the way they are treating Julian Assange, this prolific journalist and publisher who so many other journalists have depended on in the past. He has been totally left out in the cold to fend for himself. John Pilger: I have never known anything like it. There is a kind of eerie silence around the Julian Assange case. Julian has been vindicated in every possible way and yet he is isolated as few people are these days. He is cut off from the very tools of his trade, visitors aren\u2019t allowed. I was in London recently and I couldn\u2019t see him, although I spoke to people who had seen him. Rafael Correa, the former president of Ecuador, said recently that he regarded what they are doing to Julian now as torture. It was Correa\u2019s government that gave Julian political refuge, which has been betrayed now by his successor, the government led by Lenin Moreno, which is back to sucking up to the United States in the time-honored way, with Julian as the pawn and victim. Should be a \u2018Constitutional Hero\u2019 But really it comes down to the British government. Although he is still in a foreign embassy and actually has Ecuadorian nationality, his right of passage out of that embassy should be guaranteed by the British government. The United Nations Working Party on Unlawful Detentions has made that clear. Britain took part in an investigation which determined that Julian was a political refugee and that a great miscarriage of justice had been imposed on him. It is very good that you are doing this, Dennis, because even in the media outside the mainstream, there is this silence about Julian. The streets outside the embassy are virtually empty, whereas they should be full of people saying that we are with you. The principles involved in this case are absolutely clear-cut. Number one is justice. The injustice done to this man is legion, both in terms of the bogus Swedish case and now the fact that he must remain in the embassy and can\u2019t leave without being arrested, extradited to the United States and ending up in a hell hole. But it is also about freedom of speech, about our right to know, which is enshrined in the United States Constitution. If the Constitution were taken literally, Julian would be a constitutional hero, actually. Instead, I understand the indictment they are trying to concoct reads like a charge of espionage! It\u2019s so ridiculous.That is the situation as I see it, Dennis. It is not a happy one but it is one that people should rally to quickly. DB: His journalistic brethren are sounding like his prosecutors. They want to get behind Russia-gate freaks like Congressman Adam Schiff and Mike Pompeo, who would like to see Assange in jail forever or even executed. How do you respond to journalists acting like prosecutors, some of whom used his material to do stories? This is a terrible time for journalism. JP: You are absolutely right: It is a terrible time for journalism. I have never known anything quite like it in my career. That said, it is not new. There has always been a so-called mainstream which really comes down to great power in media. It has always existed, particularly in the United States. The Pulitzer Prize this year was awarded to The New York Times and The Washington Post for witch-hunting around Russia-gate! They were praised for \u201chow deeply sourced their investigations were.\u201d Their investigations turned up not a shred of real evidence to suggest any serious Russian intervention in the 2016 election.

            "question": "Which of the following tactics is used in the following text?\n\nArticle: DOJ Unseals Indictment Involving Uranium One Scandal This report was originally published by Tyler Durden at Zero Hedge The Department of Justice unsealed an 11-count indictment on Friday to a former DoD intelligence analyst-turned uranium transportation executive who stands accused of a bribery and money laundering scheme involving a Russian nuclear official connected to the Uranium One deal. The indictment corroborates a November report by The Hill that an FBI mole deeply embedded in the Russian uranium industry had gathered extensive evidence of the scheme. Mark Lambert, 54, of Mount Airy, Maryland, was charged with one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and to commit wire fraud, seven counts of violating the FCPA, two counts of wire fraud and one count of international promotion money laundering. The charges stem from an alleged scheme to bribe Vadim Mikerin, a Russian official at JSC Techsnabexport (TENEX), a subsidiary of Russia\u2019s State Atomic Energy Corporation and the sole supplier and exporter of Russian Federation uranium and uranium enrichment services to nuclear power companies worldwide, in order to secure contracts with TENEX. According to the indictment, beginning at least as early as 2009 and continuing until October 2014, Lambert conspired with others at \u201cTransportation Corporation A\u201d to make corrupt and fraudulent bribery and kickback payments to offshore bank accounts associated with shell companies, at the direction of, and for the benefit of, a Russian official, Vadim Mikerin, in order to secure improper business advantages and obtain and retain business with TENEX. \u2013DOJ While the indictment lists Lambert\u2019s company as \u201cTransportation Corporation A,\u201d a simple search reveals that Lambert is the co-President of DAHER-TLI, \u201cthe leading front end freight forwarding company dedicated to Nuclear Cargo,\u201d according to its website. In 2012, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission sent a letter to Lambert with findings that TLI had exported plutonium \u201cin excess of the maximum quantity and type applied for and licensed,\u201d and \u201cexported Australian obligated material, which was not authorized under license conditions.\u201d Prior to his 26 year tenure in the transportation industry \u2013 20 of which have been with TLI, Mr. Lambert was an Arabic Linguist for the Navy for five years, and a Senior Intel Analyst for the Department of Defense (DoD) for three years. Lambert also speaks fluent Arabic and Farsi (Persian), along with French and Italian. The indictment against Lambert corroborates prior reporting by The Hill that an FBI mole buried deep within the Russian nuclear industry had gathered extensive evidence of a scheme involving bribes and kickbacks between Russian nuclear officials and TLI \u2013 which would have transported the U.S. uranium sold to Russia in the \u201920 percent\u2019 Uranium One deal. \u201cThe Russians were compromising American contractors in the nuclear industry with kickbacks and extortion threats, all of which raised legitimate national security concerns. And none of that evidence got aired before the Obama administration made those decisions,\u201d a person who worked on the case told The Hill, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution by U.S. or Russian officials.\u201d Based on what the FBI knew \u2013 including evidence which purportedly includes a video of Russians preparing briefcases of bribe money \u2013 the Uranium One deal never should have gone through. Moreover, both Robert Mueller and current deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein were directly involved \u2013 and current Attorney General Jeff Sessions and other Justice Department officials appear to be covering for them. In short, the FBI had ample evidence of the Russian bribery plot before the Obama administration approved the Uranium One deal thanks to their embedded mole in the Russian nuclear industry. The informant \u2013 outed as energy consultant William Campbell \u2013 was \u201cthreatened\u201d by Obama admin AG Loretta Lynch to keep quiet with an iron-clad gag order, according to his attorney \u2013 former Reagan Justice Dept. official and former Chief Counsel to the Senate Intelligence Committee Victoria Toensing. After Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-VA) demanded Campbell be allowed to testify in front of Congress, the gag order was lifted. Attorney General Jeff Sessions originally tried to claim that there was no connection between Uranium One and the nuclear transport bribery case, however several congressional republicans pushed back: \u201cAttorney General Sessions seemed to say that the bribery, racketeering and money laundering offenses involving Tenex\u2019s Vadim Mikerin occurred after the approval of the Uranium One deal by the Obama administration. But we know that the FBI\u2019s confidential informant was actively compiling incriminating evidence as far back as 2009,\u201d Rep. Ron DeSantis, (R-Fla.) told The Hill. \u201cIt is hard to fathom how such a transaction could have been approved without the existence of the underlying corruption being disclosed. I hope AG Sessions gets briefed about the CI and gives the Uranium One case the scrutiny it deserves,\u201d added DeSantis, whose House Oversight and Government Reform subcommittees is one of the investigating panels. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) sent a similar rebuke last week to Rosenstein, saying the deputy attorney general\u2019s first response to the committee \u201clargely missed the point\u201d of the congressional investigations. \u201cThe essential question is whether the Obama Justice Department provided notice of the criminal activity of certain officials before the CFIUS approval of the Uranium One deal and other government decisions that enabled the Russians to trade nuclear materials in the U.S,\u201d Grassley scolded.\u201d Meanwhile, journalists John Solomon and journalist Sara Carter claim to have copies of the FBI informant\u2019s evidence, while Carter issued an explosive report in late November laying out the players, the timeline, and the evidence at hand. \u201cBy the time the sale of Uranium One was approved by the Obama Administration, the FBI\u2019s investigators had already gathered substantial evidence and the bureau was also aware of Russia\u2019s intentions to enter the U.S. energy market and its desire to purchase a stake in American uranium,\u201d Carter writes.

They\u2019re helping me examine this document, having kindly volunteered to serve as consultants, to help me understand it from an inside position. These, I might add, are not what we would consider a \u201ctraditionalist\u201d community. They have only the Novus Ordo Mass and use the new rite Divine Office in their native vernacular language. For obvious reasons I can\u2019t identify them, even to say what country they are in. Writing to me in English, by way of introductory comments in their longer analysis of the document that will be forthcoming, Sister T, fully professed and a senior member of the monastery\u2019s council, said, \u201cThe Cor Orans document is the death-knell of Carmel. It signals the end of the contemplative monastic life. Not only does it destroy the autonomy of the Monasteries, something Our Holy Mother St. Teresa was extremely insistent about, but it also removes the Superior, dissolves her authority and power, removes the financial independence of each Monastery, and destroys the specificity of each charism. \u201cThis is a disaster. Especially for Carmel.\u201d I contrast this frightening comment with those coming from the man immediately responsible for \u201cCor orans,\u201d Cardinal Jo\u00e3o Braz de Aviz, the Brazilian prefect of the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life in a speech to religious formation directors in 2015, in which he laid out pretty clearly what was coming in this piece of legislation, 3 years later. In fact, as the National Catholic Reporter piece said, the meeting itself was \u201cunprecedented,\u201d 1200 formators of religious life gathered by the Congregation for Religious in order to hear the new marching orders. This is the programme: \u201cDo not distance yourself from the great lines of the Second Vatican Council.\u201d \u201cIn fact, those that are distancing themselves from the council to make another path are killing themselves \u2013 sooner or later, they will die. They will not have sense. They will be outside the church. We need to build, using the Gospel and the Council as a departure point.\u201d After breathing this threat, the cardinal continued, saying that because modern people\u2019s \u201cneeds\u201d are fundamentally different from what they were in the past, there was no reason to stick too closely to what the founders and foundresses \u2013 people like St. Anthony, St. Augustine, St. John Cassian, St. Benedict, St. Bruno, St. Dominic, Sts. Francis and Clare, Sts. Teresa of Avila and John of the Cross - wanted. \u201cThese contexts have changed. And the council reminds us that consecrated life must be Christian discipleship ... must be discipleship of the founders that we remember, but also must be open to the culture of the present moment.\u201d \u201cWe must not be closed to new things. God is not static,\u201d the cardinal said. \u201cGod is always new movement \u2013 of light, of heat, of demonstration. He speaks in every time to men and women with the true language of that time.\u201d The congregation\u2019s Secretary, Archbishop Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez Carballo, is reported as saying, \u201cWith this explicit reference to the Second Vatican Council, we point to our profound conviction that the council is the point of reference, non-negotiable, in the formation to the consecrated life.\u201d Not the charism of the order, nor the rule, nor the Patristic tradition, nor the Doctors, nor the mystics, nor any of the 2000-year-old tradition of religious life, from the Desert Fathers to the giants of the Tridentine period; just Vatican II. And only, apparently, a single \u201cinterpretation\u201d of it, if we are to judge by the soap and oil Braz de Aviz poured on the ruffled feathers of the Leadership Conference of Women Religious \u2013 the most virulently anti-Catholic organisation of \u201cCatholic\u201d religious in the world \u2013 and by his vicious persecution of the Franciscans of the Immaculate. Carballo continues his remarks, giving us a clue as to his feelings towards strictly cloistered, contemplative religious life: \u201cA consecrated life, a life in God but inserted in the ecclesial family, in the church \u2013 inserted in the world. Not in conflict with the world, but inserted in continuity,\u201d he said. It is to wonder what this man would make of a comment by the great Dom Paul Delatte, the second abbot of Solesmes and successor to the refounder, Dom Gueranger, who wrote in his commentary on the Rule of St. Benedict: \u201cThe Prologue set this choice before us, the world or Our Lord, as mutually exclusive alternatives; we cannot remain neutral, but must belong wholly to the one or wholly to the other.\u201d \u201cAfter entering into Christ by baptism and by the monastic profession, we should hold ourselves as far aloof from the world as possible and have no connection with it. There shall no longer be more intercourse between us than there is between two corpses: \u2018The world is crucified to me and I to the world.\u2019 \u201cLet us be on our guard against thinking that it may sometimes be proper to soften the differences, to lessen the distance which separates us. The Apostle warns us that we can only please God by preserving the integrity of our true life: \u2018No man being a soldier to God, entangleth himself with secular businesses: that he may please him to whom he hath engaged himself.\u2019 The world\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

Pompeo held delicate talks Tuesday with the rulers of Saudi Arabia amid growing suspicions that a Virginia-based Saudi columnist was killed on their orders. Pompeo did not report any progress following a day of meetings in Riyadh with Saudi King Salman and his powerful son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the country\u2019s de facto ruler. President Donald Trump on Monday ordered Pompeo to rush to the desert kingdom to try to determine the fate of the missing journalist, Jamal Khashoggi, and the diplomat quickly hopped a plane. In his meetings, Pompeo conveyed \u201cU.S. concern\u201d about Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance two weeks ago, the State Department said, and stressed \u201cthe importance of a thorough, transparent, and timely investigation.\u201d The talks were \u201cdirect and candid,\u201d State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said. Pompeo reminded his hosts that despite the numerous bilateral issues the two governments share, determining Khashoggi\u2019s fate was the urgent purpose of this trip, she said. Khashoggi, a prominent critic of the autocratic Saudi leadership, was last seen entering the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, on Oct. 2, where he was seeking papers to marry his fianc\u00e9e. Turkish media reports, based in part on apparent audio recordings, have said Khashoggi was beaten to death and then dismembered in the building. A 15-member Saudi military team had entered the consulate with a bone saw shortly before Khashoggi arrived, and flew out of the country soon after, the reports said. Saudi officials insisted that Khashoggi left the consulate but have provided no video or other evidence. They have denied any responsibility for his disappearance. Hoping to stem a growing furor, Trump on Monday suggested \u201crogue killers,\u201d not the Saudi royal family, may have carried out the murder. Critics quickly said that Trump was providing an excuse for the Saudi leaders, and participating in a cover-up. That seemed to set the stage for Saudi officials to find a way to explain away the alleged shocking death. They floated the idea later Monday of claiming that Khashoggi, who wrote opinion pieces for the Washington Post and Arab media, was accidentally killed in an interrogation gone awry inside the consulate \u2014 supposedly without the approval of the king or crown prince. Publicly, Pompeo and his hosts looked calm and friendly when they met Tuesday in Riyadh. At one point, as they greeted each other, Prince Mohammed noted the two countries were important allies. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Pompeo said, smiling. The United States long guaranteed Saudi security in exchange for a steady supply of oil. Those ties have frayed even as the Trump administration has embraced the Saudi rulers as a crucial regional ally in efforts to constrain Iran and to craft a peace plan between Israel and the Palestinians. The current crisis has put those broader goals at risk, and the White House has scrambled to find a face-saving solution for the Saudi rulers. Trump has said he would impose \u201csevere\u201d punishment if proof emerges that Saudi rulers sanctioned Khashoggi\u2019s murder, but he has not said what that would entail. He has ruled out cancelling or suspending billions of dollars in arms deals with the oil-rich country. Many members of Congress have demanded the White House take tougher actions, including punitive sanctions on Saudi rulers. But Congress has taken no action on its own. \u2014 Tracy Wilkinson Los Angeles Times \u2014\u2014\u2014 \u00a92018 Los Angeles Times, Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

Democrats had Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s never-credible accusations of sexual abuse -- including possible attempted rape -- in hand way back in the summer. They deliberately refused to bring up the allegations, as weak and ridiculous as they are, at Kavanaugh\u2019s Senate confirmation hearings because they didn\u2019t want to have a rational discussion. They wanted to hurl the wild claims like a grenade at the last minute to blow up the process. And so far it appears they\u2019re succeeding. If Kavanaugh isn\u2019t in place a week from Monday, the Supreme Court will begin hearing cases in its new term shorthanded. The high court normally has a complement of nine justices but with Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy\u2019s retirement July 31, which cleared the way for Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination, there have only been eight justices in place. Roughly speaking there is a 4-to-4 liberal to conservative ideological split on the court. Democrats would prefer to drag the confirmation process into the next Congress where they hope to take control from Republicans. Election Day is November 6. The GOP currently controls the Senate, which has the final say on judicial nominations, by an uncomfortably close margin of 51 to 49. Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s lawyers are trying to game the system. They know that Senate Judiciary Committee rules require Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) to provide a full week\u2019s notice for a hearing. So, if, for example, the committee followed the rules and agreed Friday (today) to a hearing, the soonest it could be held would be next Friday, the final business day before the Supreme Court\u2019s new term begins. Of course, lawyers are masters of delay, and social justice warrior-lawyers hoping to torpedo President Trump\u2019s agenda have an added incentive to drag the confirmation process out as long as possible. New demands and fake emergencies are bound to arise from Ford\u2019s legal team. It was unclear at press time if the public hearing scheduled for Monday into the allegations of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh would go forward. Kavanaugh informed the committee he was willing to testify Monday. \u201cI continue to want a hearing as soon as possible, so that I can clear my name,\" he wrote in a letter. Ford's lawyer Debra Katz told the Judiciary Committee her client \"wishes to testify, provided that we can agree on terms that are fair and which ensure her safety.\" Another Ford attorney reportedly said Wednesday that there are \u201cmultiple witnesses\u201d who need to testify. \"A hearing on Monday is not possible and the Committee's insistence that it occur then is arbitrary in any event,\u201d Katz wrote in a letter. \u201cDr. Ford has asked me to let you know that she appreciates the various options you have suggested. Her strong preference continues to be for the Senate Judiciary Committee to allow for a full investigation prior to her testimony.\u201d GOP lawmakers are figuring out how to respond to Ford\u2019s request, the San Diego Union-Tribune reports: Late Thursday, Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), the Judiciary Committee chairman, said that his staff had discussed the issue with Ford\u2019s attorney earlier in the day and that he would consult with his fellow committee members about the next move. Ford\u2019s offer also increased the pressure on several key moderates \u2014 particularly GOP Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska \u2014 whose votes will probably be needed to put Kavanaugh on the high court. Both were already facing heavy pressure from abortion rights groups concerned that Kavanaugh, a staunch conservative and longtime GOP attorney, might vote to restrict access to abortion. The sexual assault allegation, which the nominee has denied, has upended his seemingly sure-bet confirmation and only increased the stakes for the key lawmakers. Chairman Grassley had imposed a Thursday deadline for Ford to submit testimony after her team said Tuesday she wasn\u2019t willing to testify until the FBI investigates her sexual abuse allegations against Kavanaugh. Left-wingers such as Hillary Clinton and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) echoed Ford\u2019s demand. The demand for an FBI probe is \u201cutter nonsense,\u201d former U.S. Attorney Joseph diGenova said earlier this week. Ford \u201creally doesn\u2019t want to testify,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause when she does, she is going to look like the loon she is. She may very well believe everything she\u2019s saying, and that is one of the signs of lunacy, believing something that isn\u2019t real.\u201d And her lawyer is \u201ceven loonier.\u201d Besides, diGenova explained, the eleventh-hour sexual abuse claim leveled against Kavanaugh is a non-federal matter and in this case the alleged assault hasn\u2019t even been clearly outlined by the alleged victim. Ford didn\u2019t report it to anyone for decades and isn\u2019t even certain when or where it happened, so the FBI can\u2019t investigate the matter \u201cbecause there is nothing to investigate.\u201d Kavanaugh has already undergone six FBI background checks and the agency has ruled out investigating Ford\u2019s allegation of drunken groping at a teenagers\u2019 party 36 years ago. Ford\u2019s request for an FBI probe is \u201cclearly a desire to delay proceedings,\u201d diGenova said. President Trump is taking the high road and is avoiding attacking Ford, which isn\u2019t a risky move given how obviously unbalanced the accuser is. Ford is already doing an excellent job destroying herself without Republican assistance. At the White House on Wednesday, President Trump said it would be \"wonderful\" if Ford testifies and \"unfortunate\" if she does not. He indicated he was keeping an open mind about the allegations but that it was \"very hard for me to imagine anything happened\" between her and the nominee. \"I think he's an extraordinary man \u2013 I think he's a man of great intellect, as I've been telling you, and he has an unblemished\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

This is all you need to know about the hoax that was and is Trump-Russia collusion and the Robert Mueller special counsel investigation. The Duran\u2019s Alex Christoforou and Editor-in-Chief Alexander Mercouris discuss the insurrection taking place at the US Department of Justice, as Democrats, ex-Obama officials, and DOJ directors are doing everything in their power to make sure the truth, about how the FISA warrant to spy on Carter Page was obtained, remains hidden from the eyes of the American public. Via Zerohedge\u2026 Despite President Trump\u2019s Monday order for the \u201cimmediate declassification\u201d of sensitive materials related to the Russia investigation, \u201cwithout redaction,\u201d the agencies involved are planning to do so anyway, according to Bloomberg, citing three people familiar with the matter. The Justice Department, FBI and Office of the Director of National Intelligence are going through a methodical review and can\u2019t offer a timeline for finishing, said the people, who weren\u2019t authorized to speak publicly about the sensitive matter. \u2013Bloomberg The Deep State: The Fa... Mike Lofgren Best Price: $7.55 Buy New $6.00 (as of 11:45 EDT - Details) Trump ordered the DOJ to release the text messages of former FBI Director James Comey, his deputy Andrew McCabe, now-fired special agent Peter Strzok, former FBI attorney Lisa Page and twice-demoted DOJ official Bruce Ohr. Also ordered released are specific pages from the FBI\u2019s FISA surveillance warrant application on former Trump campaign aide Carter Page, as well as interviews with Ohr. The DOJ and the FBI are expected to submit proposed redactions to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence \u2013 which will prepare a package for Trump to sign off on. \u201cWhen the president issues such an order, it triggers a declassification review process that is conducted by various agencies within the intelligence community, in conjunction with the White House counsel, to seek to ensure the safety of America\u2019s national security interests,\u201d a Justice Department spokesman said in a statement. \u201cThe department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are already working with the Director of National Intelligence to comply with the president\u2019s order.\u201d The agencies are likely to cite national security concerns over revealing classified \u201csources and methods\u201d pertaining to the Russia investigation \u2013 which will put them in direct conflict with Trump\u2019s order. Trump, as president, has the power to override the agencies and declassify material on his own. Trump\u2019s order to release the documents comes after months of requests from GOP lawmakers, while the DOJ has repeatedly denied their requests for more transparency. The FBI\u2019s spy\u2026 According to Bloomberg, the DOJ is interpreting Trump\u2019s request to include information about the use of confidential informant (spy) Stephan Halper during the early stages of the Trump-Russia investigation. After taking in over $400,000 from the Obama Pentagon under the auspices of a research contract, Halper befriended and spied on members of the Trump campaign, including aides Carter Page and George Papadopoulos.

            "question": "Which of the following tactics is used in the following text?\n\nArticle: FBI IG Report: A Slap On The Wrist Department of Justice Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz has released his 500 plus-page report, which purports to shine a light on the mishandling at top levels of the Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation of the 2016 investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private e-mail server while she served as Secretary of State under former President Obama. Such mishandling included violations of Department of Justice standards and FBI protocols. The report from the Department of Justice\u2019s Office of the Inspector General (\u201cOIG\u201d) criticized certain actions and decisions of former FBI Director James Comey, together with those of other senior FBI officials who were involved in the probe, including former Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe. Mr. McCabe is already the subject of an earlier criminal referral from the OIG for his alleged unauthorized leaks to the media and lying to federal investigators about his media contacts. Special FBI agent Peter Stzrok and Lisa Page, an attorney who has since left the FBI, were targeted in this report for their blatantly anti-Trump text messages. Former Attorney General Loretta Lynch was also criticized for exercising bad judgment in connection with her infamous tarmac meeting with Bill Clinton. Mr. Horowitz\u2019s report focused on process and procedures. The inspector general made clear when he launched his investigation in January 2017 that \u201chis review will not substitute the OIG's judgment for the judgments made by the FBI or the Department regarding the substantive merits of investigative or prosecutive decisions.\" Moreover, this report did not address whether the Department of Justice or FBI abused the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to obtain a surveillance order against former Trump campaign advisor Carter Page, or the government\u2019s reliance on former British intelligence agent Christopher Steele\u2019s salacious and unverified \u201cdossier\u201d in its FISA court application, which the OIG is investigating separately. In analyzing the highly anticipated OIG report\u2019s conclusions, it is clear that either Mr. Horowitz himself decided to pull his punches or that the final version, which had been reviewed by upper echelons in both the FBI and Justice Department before its public release, emerged in a disappointingly watered-down form. To be sure, the report faulted Comey for deviating from FBI and Justice Department procedures in handling the probe into Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private e-mail server while she served as Secretary of State, thereby negatively impacting \u201cthe perception of the FBI and the department as fair administrators of justice.\u201d Comey, according to the OIG report, \u201cengaged in ad hoc decision making based on his personal views even if it meant rejecting longstanding Department policy or practice.\u201d Starting with Comey\u2019s public announcement on July 5, 2016 criticizing Hillary Clinton and her staff for being \u201cextremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information,\u201d but also announcing that the FBI was \u201cexpressing to Justice our view that no charges are appropriate in this case,\u201d Comey was taken to task for insubordination and usurping the authority of the attorney general. He \u201cupset the well-established separation between investigative and prosecutorial functions,\u201d the report said. Comey\u2019s follow-up letters to Congress on October 28 and November 6, 2016 were similarly criticized. The first letter informed Congress that agents were reopening their probe into Clinton\u2019s handling of classified material after discovering her e-mails on the laptop of Andrew Weiner, the husband of Clinton\u2019s top aide Huma Abedin. This letter was followed on November 6, 2016 by Comey\u2019s statement that the review of the additional information had been completed and that the FBI remained convinced that charges were not appropriate. Comey acted against the advice of senior Justice Department officials in making these disclosures the way he did. The OIG report was highly critical of the FBI\u2019s failure to take immediate action on the Weiner laptop when they first learned about it in late September 2016, rather than waiting another month so close to the election. The criticisms of Comey's undisciplined behavior was all well and good, but it was reasonable to expect something more than the equivalent of a departmental employee review after nearly a year and a half of investigation. Hillary Clinton\u2019s supporters will no doubt jump on the inspector general\u2019s criticisms of Comey\u2019s handling of the July 5th announcement and subsequent letters as proof that he improperly influenced the outcome of the election in President Trump\u2019s favor, even if he did not do so deliberately for political reasons. However, what Comey really did was to give Hillary Clinton a Get Out of Jail Free card. The fix was in as early as May 2016, well before the FBI interviews of Hillary Clinton and of as many as 17 other key witnesses, when Comey began the process of drafting an exoneration memo. Comey\u2019s initial draft statement, which he shared with FBI senior leadership on May 2, criticized Clinton\u2019s handling of classified information as \u201cgrossly negligent,\u201d but concluded that \u201cno reasonable prosecutor\u201d would bring a case based on the facts developed in the investigation. Indeed, Comey admitted in his book that \u201cwe started the Clinton investigation aware that it was unlikely to be a case that career prosecutors at the Department of Justice would prosecute.\u201d If putting the cart of exoneration before the horse of investigation were not enough, Comey\u2019s draft statement underwent various language changes over the course of the next two months, including, most importantly, changing the description of Clinton\u2019s handling of classified information from \u201cgrossly negligent\u201d to \u201cextremely careless.\u201d This change was critical because \u201cgross negligence\u201d is specifically the legal term used in stating the statutory requirement in 18 U.S. Code \u00a7 793(f) for a finding of criminal conduct. Comey\u2019s substitution of a legally meaningless phrase, \u201cextremely careless,\u201d for the \u201cgross negligence\u201d statutory legal standard he had originally used, had the effect of prejudging the facts in Hillary Clinton\u2019s favor. Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page were involved in the edits. Inspector General Horowitz saw no problem\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

Fox News reports that \u201ctargeted immigration enforcement operations\u201d resulted in the arrests, about half of which snared fugitives with convictions for assault and battery, crimes against children, weapons charges and DUI. One such fugitive is a documented gang member whose \u201caccumulated criminal convictions in California... have resulted in more than 15 years of prison sentencings\u201d and who had previously been removed by ICE four times. Many of the other arrested illegals had criminal convictions from Mexico and Guatemala throughout Northern California. The arrests came despite a press release tweeted by Libby Schaaf, the Democratic mayor of Oakland, which noted that \u201cmultiple credible sources\u201d told her ICE would be conducting the raids in the Bay Area. This did not win her any friends among law enforcement. ICE Deputy Director Thomas Homan said in a statement Tuesday, The Oakland mayor\u2019s decision to publicize her suspicions about ICE operations further increased that risk for my officers and alerted criminal aliens \u2014 making clear that this reckless decision was based on her political agenda. Unlike the politicians who attempt to undermine ICE\u2019s critical mission, our officers will continue to fulfill their sworn duty to protect public safety. True to the left's support for criminality over law and order, Mayor Schaaf declared that she considered it her \"duty\" to warn criminal illegals in her area. Fox News notes that ICE officials are asking the Department of Justice to look into whether she broke any laws by doing so. ICE reports that 864 illegal immigrants with criminal convictions and other public safety threats \"remain at large\" in the area -- an indeterminate number of whom may have been tipped off by a Democrat mayor who betrayed the law-abiding citizens of Northern California.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

The war for dominance in the Middle East, following the crushing of ISIS, appears about to commence in Syria\u2014with NATO allies America and Turkey on opposing sides. Turkey is moving armor and troops south to Syria's border enclave of Afrin, occupied by Kurds, to drive them out, and then drive the Syrian Kurds out of Manbij further south as well. Says President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, \" We will destroy all terror nests, one by one, in Syria, starting from Afrin and Manbij.\" For Erdogan, the Kurdish YPG, the major U.S. ally in Syria, is an arm of the Kurdish PKK in Turkey, which we and the Turks have designated as a terrorist organization. While the Kurds were our most effective allies against ISIS in Syria, Turkey views them as a mortal peril and intends to deal with that threat. If Erdogan is serious, a clash with the U.S. is coming, as our Kurdish allies occupy most of Syria's border with Turkey. Moreover, the U.S. has announced plans to create a 30,000-man Border Security Force of Kurds and Arabs to keep ISIS out of Syria. Erdogan has branded this BSF a \"terror army,\" and President Bashar Assad of Syria has called BSF members \"traitors.\" This U.S. plan to create a BSF inside Syria, Damascus declared , \"represents a blatant attack on the sovereignty and territorial integrity and unity of Syria, and a flagrant violation of international law.\" Does not the Syrian government have a point? Now that ISIS has been driven out of Raqqa and Syria, by what authority do U.S. forces remain to arm troops to keep the Damascus government from reimposing its authority on its own territory? Secretary of State Tillerson gave Syria the news Wednesday. The U.S. troop commitment to Syria, he said, is now open-ended. Our goals: Guarantee al-Qaida and ISIS do not return and set up sanctuary; cope with rising Iranian influence in Damascus; and pursue the removal of Bashar Assad's ruthless regime. But who authorized this strategic commitment, of indefinite duration, in Syria, when near two decades in Afghanistan have failed to secure that nation against the return of al-Qaida and ISIS? Again and again, the American people have said they do not want to be dragged into Syria's civil war. Donald Trump won the presidency on a promise of no more unnecessary wars. Have the American people been had again? Will they support a clash with NATO ally Turkey, to keep armed Kurds on Turkey's border, when the Turks regard them as terrorists? Are we prepared for a shooting war with a Syrian army, backed by Russia, Iran, Hezbollah and Shiite militias from Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan, to hold onto a fourth of Syria's territory in alliance with Kurds? The U.S. coalition in Syria said this week the BSF will be built up \"over the next several years\" and \"be stationed along the borders ... to include portions of the Euphrates river valley and international borders to the east and north.\" Remarkable: A U.S.-created border army is going to occupy and control long stretches of Syria's borders with Turkey and Iraq, over Syria's objections. And the U.S. military will stand behind the BSF. Are the 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria really up to that task, should the Turks decide to cleanse the Syrian border of Kurds, or should the Syrian regime decide to take back territory occupied by the Kurds? Who sanctioned this commitment to a new army, which, if Syria and its Russian and Iranian allies, and the Turks, do not all back down, risks a major U.S. war with no allies but the Kurds? As for Syria's Kurds casting their lot with the Americans, one wonders: Did they not observe what happened when their Iraqi cousins, after helping us drive ISIS out of Mosul, were themselves driven out of Kirkuk by the Iraqi army, as their U.S. allies watched? In the six-year Syrian civil war, which may be about to enter a new phase, America faces a familiar situation. While our \"allies\" and adversaries have vital interests there, we do not. The Assads have been in power for the lifetime of most Americans. And we Americans have never shown a desire to fight there. Assad has a vital interest: preservation of his family regime and the reunification of his country. The Turks have a vital interest in keeping armed Kurds out of their border regions adjacent to their own Kurdish minority, which seeks greater independence. The Israelis and Saudi royals want the U.S. to keep Iran from securing a land bridge from Tehran to Damascus to Lebanon. The U.S. War Party wants us to smash Iran and remain in the Middle East forever to assure the hegemony of its favorites.

The Star Tribune has joined a legal effort to unseal the divorce records of U.S. Rep. Keith Ellison, the Democratic candidate for attorney general. Ellison and his ex-wife, Kim Ellison, divorced in 2012. The related records have been sealed, so the public cannot access the information. The Star Tribune\u2019s motion to intervene and unseal the records follows a similar action by Alpha News, a right-leaning online news and opinion site. The efforts follow allegations by Ellison\u2019s ex-girlfriend, Karen Monahan, that Ellison domestically abused her in 2016. He has denied the allegation repeatedly, and Monahan has continued to press her case in frequent tweets about Ellison. On Sunday, Monahan tweeted to Ellison: \u201cThis is not going away and you are making it worse for you, your family and district by lying, smearing, getting others to do your dirty work, victim shaming, etc.\u201d She referred again to a video she says she has of Ellison dragging her off a bed, which he has said did not happen. She has declined to show the video, saying it is traumatizing. She also told CNN she misplaced it. Monahan also recently released a medical record that shows she told a doctor in 2017 that she had been in an abusive relationship with Ellison. Ken Martin, the chairman of the Minnesota DFL, said Tuesday that the party\u2019s investigation of the allegations against Ellison will be finished soon, then released to the public. An external investigator was hired to conduct the inquiry. The Star Tribune argued that, given the public interest around that situation and Kim Ellison\u2019s public support of her ex-husband, the divorce records are a matter of concern to voters. Divorce records are typically public, but judges will often agree to seal them if both parties to the case agree and no one else objects. The Ellison campaign released a statement from Kim Ellison on behalf of both her and Keith Ellison. \u201cOur divorce simply isn\u2019t the public\u2019s business, and therefore, when we separated, we jointly asked the court to seal the file. Now, one month before a closely contested election for Minnesota Attorney General, a conservative group wants to probe our divorce file in search of something to use against Keith in this race. I am disappointed that the Star Tribune would choose to file this motion.\u201d\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

She did say, however, that she favors a one-state, not two-state, \u201csolution\u201d to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict: \u201cOne state. It has to be one state. Separate but equal does not work. I\u2019m only 42 years old but my teachers were of that generation that marched with Martin Luther King. This whole idea of a two-state solution, it doesn\u2019t work.\u201d Indeed it doesn\u2019t. A Palestinian state would be a new base for renewed jihad attacks against Israel. But a \u201cone-state solution\u201d would be even worse, unless that state is the current State of Israel, but that is not the one state Tlaib has in mind. She is calling for an Israeli/Palestinian state that would not be a Jewish State or a homeland for the Jewish people, but a federation in which Palestinians would soon overwhelm Jews demographically. Progressive denial of their rights would soon follow: as I show in my book The History of Jihad From Muhammad to ISIS, there has never been a majority Muslim nation in which Jews enjoyed equality of rights with Muslims. Tlaib\u2019s unitary state would be no different. The hijabed (and therefore pro-Sharia) Ilhan Omar, meanwhile, is even more hateful than Tlaib. According to the Daily Wire, in 2012 Omar tweeted: \u201cIsrael has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel. #Gaza #Palestine #Israel.\u201d Challenged about this tweet much more recently, she doubled down and attacked the man who called attention to the tweet: \u201cDrawing attention to the apartheid Israeli regime is far from hating Jews. You are a hateful sad man, I pray to Allah you get the help you need and find happiness.\u201d There is much, much worse about Omar. David Steinberg of PJ Media has done extraordinary work in shedding light on aspects of Omar\u2019s record that the establishment media has steadfastly ignored. Steinberg reports that Omar has \u201cfaced allegations -- soon backed by a remarkable amount of evidence -- that she had married her own brother in 2009, and was still legally his wife. They officially divorced in December 2017. The motivation for the marriage remains unclear. However, the totality of the evidence points to possible immigration fraud and student loan fraud.\u201d What\u2019s more, she swore to apparent falsehoods in court. But Leftists rarely have to answer for their corruption, and in a Democrat House, Omar will much more likely be celebrated than investigated. She and Tlaib will enjoy establishment media accolades as they pursue their hard-Left, anti-American, anti-Israel agenda. Their presence in the House of Representatives may be evidence of \u201cdiversity,\u201d but it is also a disquieting sign of the continued dominance of identity politics, and the increasing balkanization of the American body politic. Forthrightly pro-America, pro-Israel candidates would stand little to no chance in either of their districts. And that is indicative of a much larger problem.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

The story of the Oakland mayor who tipped off illegal alien criminals to ICE raids resulting in rapists and child sex offenders escaping arrest just keeps getting worse. Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf shocked the nation when she issued a tweet and press release on February 24 warning about impending ICE raids. Schaaf refuses to say how she learned about the ICE raids, only saying it was not from official sources. \u201cI felt that it was my duty to share the information,\u201d Schaaf said. Whatever the leak pipeline looked like, it's good odds that it began with Obama holdovers ensconced in the government. In emails we obtained through a public records request, we didn\u2019t find out who her sources were, but we do know who she was talking to before she made her big announcement. Emails reveal that hours before the announcement, a group called Centro Legal de la Raza sent the mayor information on what employers should do in case of an ICE raid. Hours before the public was warned about ICE raids, some Oakland businesses got a head start, thanks to the mayor. According to emails, the Oakland Indie Alliance, a group of independent businesses, got a message saying \u201cImportant Alert! Credible information ICE Raids in Oakland Sunday 2/25 and Monday 2/26\u201d and \u201cThis information comes directly from the Mayor.\u201d Now that last part is significant. Because there is no doubt that businesses employing illegal aliens are committing a crime. It is unlawful to hire an alien, to recruit an alien, or to refer an alien for a fee, knowing the alien is unauthorized to work in the United States.. An employer can be convicted of the felony of harboring illegal aliens who are his employees if he takes actions in reckless disregard of their illegal status, such as ordering them to obtain false documents, altering records, obstructing INS inspections, or taking other actions that facilitate the alien\u2019s illegal employment. Any business that tips off illegal aliens admits that it is aware of their status. By passing along the warning, Mayor Schaaf was tipping off criminals committing a felony.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

During the confessional, a Canadian man by the name of Jeff detailed the fact that he and his wife were in the Bellagio Resort and Casino around 11:20pm on the night of the shooting when panic broke out in the hotels lobby. Jeff begins the interview by making clear his belief that there were multiple active shooters targeting different places in Las Vegas on the night of the attack. \u201cFirst of all, I think what needs to be said is that, from my perspective, there were multiple events that occurred around Las Vegas, up and down the Strip that night. It wasn\u2019t just centralized around the Mandalay Hotel,\u201d the witness claimed. The eyewitness then goes on to directly say that he and his wife were involved in an active shooter situation at a different hotel that authorities have so far done everything in their power to cover-up. \u201cMy wife and I were in Las Vegas celebrating our 10th anniversary and on October 1st we were involved in an incident with an active shooter at the Bellagio. There is no mistake in my mind about it,\u201d he continued. Jeff then describes a scene in which he and his wife were walking through the main lobby when screams and gunfire erupted. Keep in mind, this is all information that the police and the FBI has hidden from the American people. \u201cAll of a sudden there was just a crescendo of screams that started behind us in the lobby,\u201d he claimed. \u201cThen I heard somebody yell \u2018there\u2019s a shooter! There\u2019s a shooter!\u2019 And then I heard like five or six pops, like unmistakable gunfire, unmistakably.\u201d \u201cThat was about 11:20 when we heard the shots and the screams\u2026 at that point you could hear and see the screams and see hundreds of people coming towards us.\u201d Amazingly, as Shepard Ambellas noted, \u201cThe man\u2019s claims match up to actual events captured in police audio recordings from the night of the shooting which confirms that between 11:15 and 11:18 p.m. on the night of Oct. 1 there was, in fact, something going on at the Bellagio.\u201d This testimony also backs up claims by another eyewitness, Rene Downs, who has spent the past few days doing interviews about a shooter inside the Bellagio Hotel. Slowly but surely we are starting to see the official narrative regarding the Las Vegas Massacre be completely destroyed. At this point it is strikingly obvious that authorities have lied to the American people about the worst mass shooting in our countries history.

But this is a case where Obama Inc. tried to get them to do the wrong thing. While they did the right thing. The Obama administration secretly sought to give Iran access \u2014 albeit briefly \u2014 to the U.S. financial system by sidestepping sanctions kept in place after the 2015 nuclear deal, despite repeatedly telling Congress and the public it had no plans to do so. Yet another Obama dirty deal with Iran that we're just learning about now. The question is how many more are there? And that's part of why Spygate is happening. The assault is also a cover-up. The report by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations revealed that under President Barack Obama, the Treasury Department issued a license in February 2016, never previously disclosed, that would have allowed Iran to convert $5.7 billion it held at a bank in Oman from Omani rials into euros by exchanging them first into U.S. dollars. If the Omani bank had allowed the exchange without such a license, it would have violated sanctions that bar Iran from transactions that touch the U.S. financial system. The effort was unsuccessful because American banks \u2014 themselves afraid of running afoul of U.S. sanctions \u2014 declined to participate. The Obama administration approached two U.S. banks to facilitate the conversion, the report said, but both refused, citing the reputational risk of doing business with or for Iran. That's how bad Obama was on Iran. The banking system was more reluctant to help Iran launder money than he was. Nor was Obama worried about the reputational risk of loading foreign currency on unmarked cargo planes and flying it to Iran. Issuing the license was not illegal. Still, it went above and beyond what the Obama administration was required to do under the terms of the nuclear agreement. Except Obama Inc. weren't trying to drive a hard bargain. So they didn't stick to it. They were trying to aid Iran. Shortly after the nuclear deal was sealed in July 2015, then-Treasury Secretary Jack Lew testified that even with the sanctions relief, Iran \u201cwill continue to be denied access to the world\u2019s largest financial and commercial market.\u201d A month later, one of Lew\u2019s top deputies, Adam Szubin, testified that despite the nuclear deal \u201cIran will be denied access to the world\u2019s most important market and unable to deal in the world\u2019s most important currency.\u201d This was typical of the worthless assurances that Obama officials made. And disgraced themselves by doing so. Obama administration officials at the time assured concerned lawmakers that a general license wouldn\u2019t be coming. But the report from the Republican members of the Senate panel showed that a draft of the license was indeed prepared, though it was never published. And when questioned by lawmakers about the possibility of granting Iran any kind of access to the U.S. financial system, Obama-era officials never volunteered that the specific license for Bank Muscat in Oman had been issued two months earlier. Scandal-free administration, folks. Not a single scandal to see here. Not a one.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

Specifically, one executive suggests paying for the rides of Latinos to get them to the polls \u2014 if they vote for Clinton, that is. First censorship, now this. When will something be done about these tech and social media companies? From Breitbart: An email chain among senior Google executives from the day after the 2016 presidential election reveals the company tried to influence the 2016 United States presidential election on behalf of one candidate, Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton. In the emails, a Google executive describes efforts to pay for free rides for a certain sect of the population to the polls\u2013a get-out-the-vote for Hispanic voters operation\u2013and how these efforts were because she thought it would help Hillary Clinton win the general election in 2016. She also used the term \u201csilent donation\u201d to describe Google\u2019s contribution to the effort to elect Clinton president. The main email, headlined, \u201cElection results and the Latino vote,\u201d was sent on Nov. 9, 2016\u2014the day after Clinton\u2019s loss to Trump in the 2016 presidential election\u2014by Eliana Murillo, Google\u2019s Multicultural Marketing department head. The four page email begins with Murillo claiming she and others at Google were engaged in non-partisan activities not designed to help any one candidate or another\u2014only to undercut her own commentary in later passages in the emails by openly admitting the entire effort to boost Latino turnout using Google products with official company resources was to elect Clinton over Trump. The critical miscalculation, Murillo wrote in a stunning admission in the email, was that Latino voters backed Trump by higher margins than any experts had forecast in the lead-up to the election. Trump\u2019s 29 percent among Hispanics nationally blew prognosticators away, and he hit even higher numbers\u2014about 31 percent\u2014in the key battleground state of Florida, Murillo admitted. Murillo wrote at the outset of the lengthy message: We worked very hard. Many people did. We pushed tp get out the Latino vote with our features, our partners, and our voices. We kept our Google efforts non-partisan and followed our company\u2019s protocols for the elections strategy. We emphasized our mission to give Latinos access to information so that they can make an informed decision at the polls, and we feel very grateful for all the support to do this important work. Latinos voted in record-breaking numbers, particularly with early votes. A large percentage of Latino voters in Florida were new voters who had become citizens just in time to vote. We saw high traffic for the search queries \u2018votar,\u2019 \u2018como votar,\u2019 and \u2018donde voter,\u2019 in key states like Florida and Nevada. We will be pulling in more info in the coming hours/days but so far we definitely know there was high traffic on search in Spanish. Without translating our tools the users wouldn\u2019t have found the information they needed. Objectively speaking, our goal was met \u2014 we pushed and successfully launched the search features in Spanish, and we thank Lisa for her support in advocating for this work. I sent Philipp a note yesterday to thank him because he and others voiced their support for this too, and we greatly appreciate it. Even Sundar gave the effort a shout out and a comment in Spanish, which was really special. \u201cSundar\u201d presumably refers to Google\u2019s chief executive officer Sundar Pichai, who took the reins of the massive search giant in October 2015. \u201cLisa\u201d presumably refers to Lisa Gevelber, the vice president of Global Marketing for Google\u2014who forwarded Murillo\u2019s entire four-page email to several other Google executives in another chain also obtained by Breitbart News in which Gevelber praises Murillo\u2019s activities with official company resources as having made a \u201cgreat difference.\u201d \u201cPhilipp\u201d presumably refers to Philipp Schindler, a senior vice president and Google\u2019s chief business officer per his LinkedIn page. The emails were first revealed on Fox News on Monday evening on Tucker Carlson Tonight by anchor Tucker Carlson in a special report. Breitbart News also obtained them, and has reached out to Google with a number of questions about the emails. Carlson, in his exclusive report on Fox News Monday night, compared the revelations in the Google emails to the probe of Russian interference in the U.S. election to Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2014raising the question about how much influence tech giants like Google and Facebook have on election outcomes in the United States. Carlson cited Dr. Robert Epstein, a social scientist and an expert on Google, who has said, in Carlson\u2019s words, \u201cGoogle alone could determine the outcome of almost any election just by altering its search selections and we would never know it.\u201d Epstein has published research detailing how Google could influence the results of U.S. elections. Breitbart News has exclusively published several of Epstein\u2019s reports, including a recent one showing that Google search manipulation can swing huge swaths of voters. In his report on Monday night, Carlson then described the emails he obtained, which Breitbart News also obtained. Carlson said: This wasn\u2019t a get-out-the-vote effort or whatever they say. It wasn\u2019t aimed at all potential voters. It wasn\u2019t even aimed at a balanced cross-section of subgroups.

Immediately upon learning of the altercation, the bar announced that it had fired Jimenez because they believed such behavior was immoral, uncalled for, and not in keeping with Rumble\u2019s welcoming personality. On their Facebook page, they wrote, \u201c\u2026We have since terminated this employee, as his actions go against everything that this establishment stands for. Rumble has, and always will be, a bar that is as inclusive as any establishment could possibly be. THIS BAR IS A SAFE SPACE FOR EVERYONE!

My question is; how big of a leap would it be for a normal, rational adult to go from confronting administration officials to attacking the people who elected them to power? Not much in my mind.

This is hardly surprising, as the misnamed federal \u201cGun-Free Schools\u201d law leaves schoolchildren defenseless against mass shooters. Removing one\u2019s children from government schools seems a rational response to school shootings. School shootings are not the only form of violence causing more parents to consider homeschooling. Many potential homeschooling parents are concerned about the failure of school administrators to effectively protect children from bullying by other students. Of course, many parents choose homeschooling as a means of protecting their children from federal education \u201creforms\u201d such as Common Core.

The spread of cultural Marxism has contributed to the dumbing down of public education. Too many government schools are more concerned with promoting political correctness than ensuring that students receive a good education. Even if cultural Marxism did not dumb down education, concerns that government schools are indoctrinating children with beliefs that conflict with parents\u2019 political, social, and even religious beliefs would motivate many families to homeschool. Even when government schools are not intentionally promoting cultural Marxism or other left-wing ideologies, they are still implicitly biased toward big government. For example, how many government schools teach the Austrian economics explanation for the Great Depression \u2014 much less question the wisdom of central banking \u2014 or critically examine the justifications for America\u2019s hyper-interventionist foreign policy? Parents interested in providing their children with a quality education emphasizing the ideas of liberty should consider looking into my homeschooling curriculum. The Ron Paul Curriculum provides students with a well-rounded education that includes rigorous programs in history, mathematics, and the physical and natural sciences. The curriculum also provides instruction in personal finance. Students can develop superior oral and verbal communication skills via intensive writing and public speaking courses. Another feature of my curriculum is that it provides students the opportunity to create and run their own internet businesses. The government and history sections of the curriculum emphasize Austrian economics, libertarian political theory, and the history of liberty. However, unlike government schools, my curriculum never puts ideological indoctrination ahead of education. While government schools \u2014 and even many private schools \u2014 pretend religion played no significant role in history, my curriculum addresses the crucial role religion played in the development of Western civilization. However, the materials are drafted in such a way that any Christian, Jewish, Muslim, or atheist parent can feel comfortable using the curriculum. Interactive forums allow students to engage with and learn from each other. The forums ensure students are actively engaged in their education as well as give them an opportunity to interact with their peers outside of a formal setting. Concern about the safety of students in government-run schools is one reason many parents are considering homeschooling, but it is not the only reason. Many parents are motivated by a desire to give their children something better than a curriculum that has been dumbed down by federal initiatives like Common Core. Other parents do not wish to have their children indoctrinated with views that contradict the parents\u2019 political, social, or even religious beliefs. I encourage all parents looking at alternatives to government schools \u2014alternatives that provide children with a well-rounded education that introduces them to the history and ideas of liberty \u2014 to go to RonPaulCurriculum.com for more information about my homeschooling program.

Authorities found all the children living in deplorable living conditions after raiding the property looking specifically for a three-year-old boy. According to The Daily Caller, the police didn\u2019t find the little boy, named Abdul-Ghani Wahhaj, but they did discover 11 other children between the ages of one and 15-years-old being held in the \u201csaddest living conditions and poverty I have seen,\u201d Taos County Sheriff Jerry Hogrefe said in a statement posted to the agency\u2019s Facebook page Saturday. Hogrefe also added that he only saw a few potatoes and a box of rice as food at the compound. Abdul-Ghani\u2019s mother reported her son missing after Wahhaj took the boy, who turned 4 on Monday, to the park in Clayton County, Georgia, and didn\u2019t return, The Albuquerque Journal reported. She added the boy suffers from a medical condition. Investigators believe that the three-year-old boy, who turned four on Monday, they were looking for had been at the compound in earlier weeks. Siraj Wahhaj, 39, and Lucas Morten, two very heavily armed men who are believed to be \u201cextremist[s] of the Muslim belief,\u201d were running the horrifying compound, Hogrefe said. When police arrived on the scene, Wahhaj was armed with an AR-15-style rifle and several loaded 30-round magazines. He also allegedly had on him four loaded pistols. According to a report by Fox News, Hogrefe said authorities had conducted surveillance of the compound while looking for the missing boy before he decided Thursday to get a search warrant. The warrant was immediately obtained after a Georgia investigator forwarded a message in which someone at the compound reportedly told another person that people who were living in the shanty were starving and needed water. \u201cThe message sent to a third party simply said in part, \u2018We are starving and need food and water,\u2019\u201d Hogrefe said. \u201cI absolutely knew that we couldn\u2019t wait on another agency to step up and we had to go check this out as soon as possible.\u201d Police stated on Sunday that they are still looking for Abdul-Ghani.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

The book illustrates how the Jihadist Psychopath has, with the help of the Left, successfully built his totalitarian plantation in the West -- on which the political and cultural establishment is now enslaved and dutifully following his orders. Jamie outlines the frameworks of this tyrannical plantation and how those who are trapped on it, and yearn for freedom, can best escape.] Frontpage editors are happy to announce our free speech victory: Facebook has lifted Frontpage editor Jamie Glazov's 30-day ban on Facebook, apologizing and saying that the block was a \u201cmistake\u201d. We have no doubt, of course, that no \u201cmistake\u201d had actually occurred in this matter and that the ban has only been lifted because of the publicity that we engaged in -- and received. While it is a positive development that Facebook has lifted the ban on Jamie (for now), this story is crucial to amplify now more than ever, seeing that Facebook, and all of leftist-run social media, is, at this moment, clearly accelerating its totalitarian attack on the free speech of conservatives. (See Jamie's video on this whole surreal affair HERE). A brief recap of Jamie's story: on Sept. 11, the 17th Anniversary of the 9/11 terror strike, Facebook's Unholy Alliance masters informed Jamie that he was suspended from Facebook for 30 days due to his posting of his article, 9 Steps to Successfully Counter Jihad, which Facebook informed him violated their \"community standards.\" This suggested, of course, that giving advice on how to prevent another 9/11, and all other Jihadist attacks against America, is now against Facebook\u2019s \u2018community standards\u2019. (Read the whole story HERE.) Frontpage and Jamie immediately publicized this tyrannical behavior of Facebook. Then, yesterday, on Sept. 13, Facebook notified Jamie that it had made a mistake and that it was lifting his block. It goes without saying that this retraction and surrender by Facebook occurred only because of the wide publicity that Jamie's banning had received. And we are immensely grateful for all the massive support that was given to us across the Internet, including especially from Breitbart, PJMedia, WorldNetDaily and Thomas Lifson at American Thinker. Leading brave conservative figures such as Michelle Malkin and Laura Loomer also stood up for Jamie, tweeting about his ban -- and to them we send our heartfelt appreciation. Jamie is, of course, no stranger to social media censorship -- especially of the insane variety. The Counter Jihad Coalition's (CJC) Facebook page, which Jamie helped run with CJC President Steve Amundson, was removed a few years ago with absolutely no explanation. The CJC is a human rights and pro-national security group that is dedicated to protecting America and the West from Jihad -- and Muslim and non-Muslim people from Sharia oppression. The question remains: why would Facebook remove such a page, let alone in such a fascistic manner -- and never explain why? In April earlier this year, Jamie was suspended from Facebook for posting screenshots of a Muslim's threat to him on the platform. Then, in May, his Twitter account was temporarily suspended and he was forced to delete tweets he posted which directly quoted Islamic religious texts. His account was suspended for violating Twitter\u2019s rules relating to \u201chateful conduct.\u201d It is \"hateful conduct\", apparently, to reference what Islamic texts themselves say. Indeed, Frontpage's editor had simply referred to Sahih Bukhari\u2019s texts discussing Mohammed\u2019s marriage to Aisha when she was six years old (7.62.88) and to Qur'anic Suras that mandate the Hijab for women (24:31; 33:59) and sanction sexual slavery (4:3; 33:50). One thing we know for sure is that, despite this lifting of Jamie\u2019s ban, Facebook and the leftist totalitarians in other social media venues and in the culture at large will continue their unrelenting effort to suffocate dissent and conservative voices. On Facebook, many brave conservative truth-tellers continue to be censored in myriad ways; these individuals include Anni Cyrus, Bosch Fawstin, Mark Lutchman and, of course, Diamond & Silk. The case of #WalkAway leader Brandon Straka is especially disturbing: he was recently banned by Facebook for the crime of announcing that he would be interviewed by Alex Jones. Prager U has had its videos mysteriously disappear off of Facebook and then, only after vociferous protest, re-appear. Facebook is, of course, just one terrain of this leftist brownshirt-style assault on free speech. Everyone knows by now, for instance, what has happened, in the most Orwellian sense, to Alex Jones and InfoWars on Facebook, YouTube and Twitter. Leading scholar of Islam and JihadWatch.org Director Robert Spencer, meanwhile, is not just a target at Facebook, where his referrals are down 90% from what they once were; he has been banned by Patreon at the behest of MasterCard -- and MasterCard has yet to respond to his lawyer\u2019s letter. GoFundMe has also banned Spencer because of a smear by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) hate machine. Speaking of Mastercard, the David Horowitz Freedom Center just recently won a major battle with the credit card, defeating well-financed leftwing groups that are trying to run the Center out of business and suffocate free speech in America. The Freedom Center emerged victorious, but it is clear that leftist hate groups such as the SPLC and Color of Change.org are preparing new attacks against the Freedom Center and other conservative groups and individuals 24/7. To be sure, the Left's attacks on the David Horowitz Freedom Center continue unabated: just recently a hit piece in the Washington Post smeared a stand-up noble gentleman like Florida Gubernatorial Candidate Republican Ron DeSantis, libeling David Horowitz in the process. The article stated falsely and maliciously that Horowitz's Restoration Weekend, that DeSantis had attended, was somehow \u201ca racially charged event\u201d -- a vicious lie that Frontpage\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

Karen Monahan\u2019s account in the doctor\u2019s report is consistent with what she has been saying publicly since August: that Ellison was emotionally and physically abusive to her while the two were dating.

The Pope couldn\u2019t resist an anti-Semitic shot at Israeli \u201coccupation,\u201d but he also seemed to denounce Islamic jihad activity, saying: \u201cSo many conflicts have been stoked too by forms of fundamentalism and fanaticism that, under the guise of religion, have profaned God\u2019s name \u2013 which is peace \u2013 and persecuted age-old neighbors.\u201d He decried the \u201cthirst for profit that surreptitiously exploits oil and gas fields without regard for our common home, with no scruples about the fact that the energy market now dictates the law of coexistence among peoples!\u201d The Pope lamented the fact that in recent years the Middle East has been \u201ccovered by dark clouds of war, violence and destruction, instances of occupation and varieties of fundamentalism, forced migration and neglect.\u201d And he deplored the fact that \u201call this has taken place amid the complicit silence of many. The Middle East has become a land of people who leave their own lands behind.\u201d He cried: \u201cIndifference kills, and we desire to lift up our voices in opposition to this murderous indifference. For the Middle East today is weeping, suffering and silent as others trample upon those lands in search of power or riches.\u201d These are odd statements coming from Pope Francis, a world-class Islamopanderer; notice that he said nothing about who was doing the persecuting, and implied that it was the fault of powers outside the Middle East. The Catholic Church as a whole has committed itself to Islamopandering, such that it is largely silent about the Muslim persecution of Christians that has taken place in the Middle East. Why? The Catholic Church is following Pope Francis\u2019 lead, and Francis has said: \u201cChristian terrorism does not exist, Jewish terrorism does not exist, and Muslim terrorism does not exist. They do not exist.\u201d And he has also said: \u201cAuthentic Islam and the proper reading of the Koran are opposed to every form of violence.\u201d take our poll - story continues below Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?

This has had a terrible influence upon the Catholic Church, and aids and abets the Western political and media elites in their determination to cover up the Muslim persecution of Christians. Jean-Cl\u00e9ment Jeanbart, the Melkite Greek Catholic Archbishop of Aleppo, gave an interview to a French reporter in which he was highly critical of the mainstream media and even of his fellow bishops for ignoring the Muslim persecution of Middle Eastern Christians. \u201cThe European media,\u201d he charged, \u201chave not ceased to suppress the daily news of those who are suffering in Syria and they have even justified what is happening in our country by using information without taking the trouble to verify it.\u201d And as for his brother bishops in France, \u201cthe conference of French bishops should have trusted us, it would have been better informed. Why are your bishops silent on a threat that is yours today as well? Because the bishops are like you, raised in political correctness. But Jesus was never politically correct, he was politically just!\u201d Archbishop Jeanbart was not the first to say this. \u201cWhy, we ask the western world, why not raise one\u2019s voice over so much ferocity and injustice?\u201d asked Cardinal Angelo Bagnasco, the head of the Italian Bishops Conference (CEI). Syriac Catholic Patriarch Ignatius Ephrem Joseph III Younan himself has in the past appealed to the West\u201cnot to forget the Christians in the Middle East.\u201d The former Melkite Greek Catholic Patriarch Gregory III has also said: \u201cI do not understand why the world does not raise its voice against such acts of brutality.\u201d But Gregory III should have understood, since he was a major part of the problem. He himself said: \u201cNo one defends Islam like Arab Christians.\u201d It is to defend Islam that Western clerics do not raise their voice against such acts of brutality. It is to pursue a fruitless and chimerical \u201cdialogue\u201d that bishops in the U.S. and Europe keep silent about Muslim persecution of Christians, and enforce that silence upon others. Robert McManus, Roman Catholic Bishop of Worcester, Massachusetts, said it on February 8, 2013 as he was suppressing a planned talk at a Catholic conference on that persecution: \u201cTalk about extreme, militant Islamists and the atrocities that they have perpetrated globally might undercut the positive achievements that we Catholics have attained in our inter-religious dialogue with devout Muslims.\u201d Remember that Mohamed Atta, about the plane he had hijacked on September 11, 2001, told passengers over the intercom: \u201cStay quiet and you\u2019ll be OK.\u201d The Catholic Church appears to have adopted that statement as its policy regarding Muslim persecution of Christians. \u201cLeave them; they are blind guides.

As nations grapple with the outbreak of the bubonic plague, nine countries are sounding warnings that the disease is spreading rapidly. The deadly plague outbreak that has struck Madagascar\u2019s major cities has yet to \u201cpeak\u201d and that could make the spread of this infection into the surrounding regions more likely. Dr. Ashok Chopra, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Texas, told The Sun Online the crisis in Madagascar had yet to peak. He also sounded the alarm to neighboring countries. Since there are regular flights in and out of Madagascar and this outbreak has so far, been impossible to contain, other nations are now at risk. Speaking from Madagascar, Christine South, head of IFRC\u2019s (International Federation of Red Cross) emergency operations, said: \u201cWith anything like this there is a possibility that somebody could be infected and get on a plane. We have done preparedness support to some of the neighboring countries.\u201d Tourists have been warned to stay out of Madagascar until doctors can get the plague under control to prevent its spread. The outbreak is considered a much bigger threat to the region than in previous years because it has taken on its pneumonic form. That means it is airborne and spread by sneezing and coughing. Not only that, but the plague has a very short incubation time. Once exposed, some people will die within 24 hours. Experts say the epidemic could still worsen as the death tolls hit 124 and more than 1,300 are left infected. The World Health Organization (WHO) has now issued alarming warnings in nine countries too. \u201cIf they are traveling shorter distances and they\u2019re still in the incubation period, and they have the pneumonic (form) then they could spread it to other places,\u201d said Chopra. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to have a situation where the disease spreads so fast it sort of gets out of control. Most of the cases in the past have been of the bubonic plague but if you look at this particular outbreak, 70 percent of the cases are pneumonic plague, which is the most deadly form of the disease. If the treatment is not given in a very short period of time these people will end up dying.\u201d Both forms of the plague can be cured with antibiotics, but getting treatment quickly is the key to survival.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

Thus, it took more than a year-and-a-half for the Factory to roll out the old reliable \u201cmistranslation\u201d defense to explain away the infamous paragraph 303 of Amoris Laetita (AL), which reads as follows in the official English translation on the Vatican website: Yet conscience can do more than recognize that a given situation does not correspond objectively to the overall demands of the Gospel. It can also recognize with sincerity and honesty what for now is the most generous response which can be given to God, and come to see with a certain moral security that it is what God himself is asking amid the concrete complexity of one\u2019s limits, while yet not fully the objective ideal. In other words, the conscience can \u201cinform\u201d a sinner that his continued sinning is not only acceptable to God but is even what God is asking \u201cfor now,\u201d given one\u2019s particular \u201climits.\u201d This outrageous proposition, a form of situation ethics that strikes at the very foundation of Catholic moral teaching, has justly provoked a storm of criticism from lay and clerical defenders of the authentic Magisterium. But it\u2019s all a misunderstanding, say Dr. Robert Fastiggi, professor of Systematic Theology at Sacred Heart Major Seminary, and Dr. Dawn Eden Goldstein, S.T.D., professor of Dogmatic Theology at Holy Apostles College and Seminary. All of the critics of AL are wrong\u2014every one of them!\u2014because, you see, the original Latin text does not say what the English text does. Dr. Robert Fastiggi and Dr. Dawn Goldstein Here we go again. So what does the Latin say? Here is the paragraph in the official Latin: Haec autem conscientia agnoscere potest non modo statum quendam ab universali Evangelii mandato obiective dissidere; etiam sincere honesteque agnoscere poteste quod sit liberale responsum in praesenti Deo reddendum atque eadem conscientia firma quadam morali certitudine intellegere illam esse oblationem quam ipse Deus requirit inter rerum impedientium congeriem, quamvis perfectum nondum sit obiectivum exemplar. Yes, and so what? Well, according to Fastiggi and Goldstein, while the English translation reads: \u201cwhat for now is the most generous response which can be given to God,\u201d the Latin employs the word oblationem, which means offering. So, What the Pope Really Means\u00ae is: \u201cwhat for now is the most generous offering which can be given to God.\u201d So, it\u2019s an offering to God, not a response to God. Big difference. But just a moment: how can objectively immoral behavior ever be characterized as an \u201coffering\u201d to God? It would seem the Latin version has graver implications than the English because it suggests that falling short of what the moral law requires is an oblation pleasing to God if one\u2019s \u201climits\u201d make obedience to the moral law difficult. And that is exactly the nonsense Fastiggi and Goldstein expect us to swallow: \u201cPope Francis is not talking about an offering of an objectively sinful action but a gift of self that moves toward God and the objective moral norm.\u201d So, our intrepid presenters of What the Pope Really Means\u00ae would have us believe that objectively immoral behavior, which is the best one can do according \u201cthe \u201cconcrete complexity of one\u2019s limits,\u201d is no longer simply objectively immoral behavior but rather a gift of self because it moves toward morally licit behavior. Fastiggi and Goldstein have managed to make the problem even worse in their attempt to explain it away. What about the English locution \u201cwhile yet not fully the objective ideal,\u201d which seems to reduce the negative precepts of the natural law to mere ideals? Not so, Fastiggi and Goldstein contend. Do not all those ignorant critics of AL know that the Latin text employs the phrase \u201cobiectivum exemplar,\u201d which, translated literally into English is \u201cobjective exemplar.\u201d They declare triumphantly: \u201cThe Latin term exemplar does not mean an unattainable ideal, it specifically means a pattern or model to follow.\u201d Give. Me. A. Break. A pattern or model to follow is an ideal, as a standard Latin dictionary confirms with its definition of exemplar: \u201c(1) copy/reproduction, (2) model, pattern, example, original, ideal. Likewise, the definition of the English word \u201cexemplar\u201d is simply: \u201can ideal model.\u201d Here too Fastiggi and Goldsetein only worsen the problem they try to explain away. For if moral behavior is now to be viewed as merely \u201cexemplary\u201d rather than divinely mandated by the natural law that binds all men\u2014including Thou Shalt Not Commit Adultery\u2014then basic morality becomes a kind of heroic virtue. Thus, continence cannot realistically be expected, at least \u201cfor now\u201d (AL 303), of the average Joe or Jane with an \u201cex\u201d who has \u201cremarried\u201d and is now mired in the \u201cconcrete complexity one\u2019s limits.\u201d So, as Fastiggi and Goldstein would have it, all the tumult triggered by AL is just a misunderstanding caused by uninformed people who haven\u2019t consulted the Latin text\u2014including those ignorant Vatican translators. According to their proposed \u201calternate translation\u201d into English, What the Pope Really Means\u00ae is that objectively immoral behavior one feels unable to correct due to one\u2019s \u201climits\u201d is \u201cthe offering that God himself is asking amid the mass of impediments, although it may not yet be the perfect objective model.\u201d Which is what the official English translation already says but with fewer words. It seems Fastiggi and Goldstein are hoping no one will notice that their linguistic tinkering produces no real change in meaning but only an intensification of its perniciousness. Indeed, their \u201cproposed alternate translation\u201d reduces the avoidance of adulterous relations in \u201csecond marriages\u201d to the \u201cperfect objective model.\u201d Now, how could anyone but a Pharisee expect perfection from people living in adultery? Are you perfect? Then again, the Pharisees are precisely the ones Our Lord condemned for accommodating divorce and remarriage in violation of the natural law. But such embarrassing truths need not impede the Bergoglian Mercy Train as it barrels toward a train wreck at the end of the line.

This, though, is no longer an issue because the normative text is the Latin text published in thr AAS. Mr. Ferrara, however, bases his critique upon an assumption that the \u201cgenerous response\u201d offered to God is a sin. This, though, is not what AL is saying. The generous response is a move away from sin and a move toward God. I explain this in my most recent response to Prof. E. Christian Brugger, which can serve as my response to Mr. Ferrara: Posted on LifeSiteNews: Prof. Brugger is a good theologian and a fine man, but he still seems to believe that AL 303 implies that God is asking people to continue to sin in some cases. In his April 22, 2016 article in Catholic World Report, Brugger writes that AL 303 suggests that \u201cGod can be \u2018asking\u2019 someone to live in a life-state in which they are objectively violating grave matter.\u201d Then in a Sept. 28 \u201817 LifeSiteNews article, he states that \u201cthe generous response\u201d owed to God is \u201ca certain state that is objectively at variance with the universal command of the Gospel.\u201d Now Prof. Brugger argues that, because the subject remains \u201cthis conscience\u201d in AL 303, this proves that the \u201cgenerous offering owed to God\u201d is the recognition that one is living \u201ccontrary to \u201cthe universal command of the Gospel.\u201d Prof. Brugger fails to see that AL 303 clearly distinguishes between a conscience\u2019s recognition that \u201ca given situation is objectively at variance with the general mandate of the Gospel\u201d and this same conscience\u2019s subsequent recognition of a \u201cgenerous response owed to God in the present circumstances.\u201d The subject \u201cconscience\u201d might be the same but the object is different. The \u201cgenerous response\u201d is not the situation that is at variance with the command of the Gospel but an offering that God is asking amid the mass of impediments even though it may not yet be the perfect objective model. What might be this \u201cgenerous response?\u201d Pope Francis does not give an example in AL 303 because he\u2019s speaking in general terms of the dynamics of conscience. Moreover, he knows that concrete cases vary widely. In our Sept. 26 article in La Stampa, Dr. Goldstein and I provided a hypothetical example of a couple in a purely civil \u201cmarriage\u201d recognizing that God is calling them to live in continence. We chose this example deliberately to demonstrate that \u201cthe generous response\u201d could be the ending of a particular sin. Our example was an attempt to show that Professors Brugger and Seifert are wrong to believe AL 303 implies that God is asking some people to continue to live in an objectively sinful state. It\u2019s really just the opposite. AL 303 teaches that conscience will come to recognize that God is asking for a step in the right direction away from sin. Pope Francis explains this again in AL 305 when he says \u201ca small step, in the midst of great human limitations, can be more pleasing to God than a life which appears outwardly in order, but moves through the day without confronting great difficulties.\u2019\u201d In a recent interview (http://www.lastampa.it/2017..., the Italian philosopher, Rocco Buttiglione, provides this example for AL 303: \u201cImagine a father who has a sick son and the child improves. He still has fever but has stopped vomiting; the child manages to keep in his stomach what he eats and has started a therapy that seems to work. The father is happy. Is he happy about the fact that the child is sick? No, he is pleased that his son gives symptoms of improvement and healing.\u201d This is what Pope Francis is saying in AL 303. God is not happy with situations that are objectively at variance with the command of the Gospel. God, however, is happy when people in such situations discern in conscience that He is asking them to make a choice that moves in the right direction\u2014even if they still need to progress further toward a more complete fulfillment of His will. This is the law of gradualness not the gradualness of the law. It is sad that this beautiful and compassionate message of AL 303 has been so completely misunderstood by scholars who have failed to grasp its true meaning. Chris Ferrara to Robert Fastiggi \u2022 9 hours ago I certainly agree that the Latin text is the normative text even if it comes later. I certainly do not agree that the Latin text eliminates the grave problems with Amoris Laetitia. Rather, as I show in my article, it only intensifies them. With all due respect to Dr. Fastiggi, his argument and that of Buttiglione, that a \u201cmove away from sin\u201d is what is pleasing to God, even if the moral norm is not adhered to, is sophistical. What constitutes a \u201cmove away\u201d from sin if not ceasing to commit the sin? No example is provided in AL because none can be. The notion is nonsensical. Just how nonsensical is demonstrated by Dr. Fastiggi\u2019s claim that by \u201ca move away from sin\u201d in the case of a divorced and \u201cremarried\u201d couple Francis means their agreement to live in continence as brother and sister for the sake of children. But that would be ceasing to commit the sin of adultery altogether as it would involve abandoning the pretense that they are married along with the illicit sexual relation itself. Such a couple could always be absolved and receive Holy Communion under the Church\u2019s constant practice, albeit privately\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

The meeting covered Carmels of the Teresian, Discalced, reform from Germany, five areas of Spain, three from France, Great Britain, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Austria, Croatia and the Holy Land [1] . The reports from each region showed that many of the provisions found in Cor orans were already in place: federations with broad powers, including financial control and combined formation courses, \u201creligious assistant\u201d priests appointed by the federation and overseeing individual monasteries and superiors giving up their authority to the federations. Given that this was 2009, it is clear that the plans to force all contemplative monasteries in the world into this disastrous European mould were well under way long before Pope Benedict was even considering resigning. Today I\u2019ve received an interesting document issued by the Carmelite Order in Europe following a meeting of the \u201cFederations of Discalced Carmelite Nuns of Europe & the Holy Land\u201d in Avila, February 2009. As a snapshot of the current condition of Carmelite monastic life after it had been completely \u201cfederated,\u201d it paints a depressing picture; but as a demonstration of what \u201cfederations\u201d are likely to achieve once Cor orans is implemented universally, it clangs in the mind like a funeral bell. Reconciled to managed extinction The report shows average ages of nuns between 65 and 80, \u201cinfirmary Carmels,\u201d nuns in state nursing homes, entire communities living in care facilities and half the Carmels with no one in formation. Solutions offered are equally uniform: heaped-up bureaucracy, common formation courses between monasteries developed by \u201creligious psychologists,\u201d ever more powers handed to federations. This is federated Carmelite monastic life under Pope Francis\u2019 New Paradigm of fully implemented VaticanTwoism. Very little is said of any efforts being made to increase vocational outreach using the internet or through diocesan contacts. And perhaps most telling of all, not one word is offered of applying any systematic religious solutions; no one is suggesting increased prayer or fasting, Rosary campaigns or novenas in what has to be the Carmelite Order\u2019s most desperate hour. Nothing is said of increased intensity of devotion to the charism, study of the foundress or returning to sources, still less of strengthening the Carmelites\u2019 traditional independent self-governance or reconsidering the wisdom of \u201cthe path taken\u201d. Indeed, in one case in Spain, the sisters themselves advocate abandoning traditional Teresian autonomy altogether. The report from Great Britain notes: \u201c18 Carmels have closed in the last 40 years. There have been two amalgamations in recent years and another one involving three Carmels is in process. Two communities at present are living together in one monastery as a temporary measure.\u201d The case of the Netherlands is downright bizarre; sisters so old that even the federation structures are breaking down. Only one fully autonomous functioning Carmel still exists in the Netherlands, and the remains of four entire communities are living in a single care home run by religious brothers. But in this situation, the \u201csolution\u201d undertaken has been an elaborate bureaucratic reshuffle, including gaining approval from Rome, for \u201ca completely new structure,\u201d whose main task, no doubt, will be the making of funeral arrangements and disposing of library books. The atmosphere is weirdly resigned \u2013 one federation report recommended simply \u201cforgetting the numbers\u201d \u2013 with many notes of mutual congratulation over \u201cunity,\u201d the creating of \u201clinks\u201d and the \u201cbuilding of trust\u201d and \u201cdialogue\u201d between communities. The report from Belgium \u2013 federated in 1997, average age 73 with one sister in formation for 11 monasteries \u2013 states tersely that their biggest problem is \u201cageing\u201d but under \u201cpossible solutions\u201d says only, \u201cWe want to continue along the path we have begun.\u201d It is only in the report from Croatia where the problem changes abruptly from aging nuns and no vocations to too many vocations with not enough room[2]. It is also notable that it is only in the Croatian report that Christ gets a direct mention. Federation of Croatia & Bosnia-Herzegovina: 82 nuns in 5 convents, with an average age of 47, and eleven in formation. This outlier differs from the Western European federations in several respects, notably that it was only federated in 2002. But the effects of the federating/formation courses are already being felt: \u201cNowadays, two monasteries have difficulty because of a lack of vocations.\u201d Path taken: Have made a foundation in Albania; however this community is not federated. From the beginning, our Association has organized formation courses for the younger sisters as well as courses of permanent formation. Each year, we have one or two seminars, which are also the occasion to the meeting of the Council of the Association. The duration is 3 to 4 days and they take place every time in a different Monastery of the Association. We invite the sisters of other Carmelite convents friends to our formation courses: sisters from Albania, Slovenia and Bulgaria. Present Problems: In general, in our Association the vocations continue growing, but there are differences between the monasteries. Nowadays, two monasteries have difficulty because of a lack of vocations. Possible solutions: We do all what is in our hands in the area of the vocational promotion, collaborating in this way with Christ who calls by his Spirit. These self-generated reports were made in response to a questionnaire set out for the meeting. All speak of nothing but bureaucratic responses: shared \u201cformation courses,\u201d meetings of superiors, amalgamations and suppression of houses and finally \u201ccare homes\u201d and houses given over entirely as infirmaries. A tale of controlled, systematized extinction. ~~~ Federation: Germany date when erected: 1980 number of convents: 14 number of nuns: 178 solemnly professed: 170 in formation[3]: 8 average age: 66 Path taken: for 15 years they have organized formation courses: on-going & initial formation, and for formators. Meetings for prioresses. Present problems: have got very old. Some sisters are in care-homes run by Franciscans. Different sisters have volunteered to help there. Possible solutions: two convents intend to amalgamate. ~~~ Federation:\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

Now, after several days of outcry from the community, Guyger has been arrested and Charged with manslaughter in the death of 26-year-old Botham Jean. In a statement released on Friday, Dallas police said their officer called them after shooting Jean and told responding officers that \u201cshe entered the victim\u2019s apartment believing that it was her own.\u201d On September 6, 2018 at about 9:59 p.m., an off duty Dallas Police officer called police dispatch and said she was involved in a shooting at the apartments located at 1210 S.

Preliminary information suggests that the officer arrived home in full uniform after working a full shift. The officer reported to the responding officers that she entered the victim\u2019s apartment believing that it was her own. At some point, the officer fired her weapon striking the victim. Responding officers administered aid to the victim, a 26-year-old male, at the scene. The victim was then transported to the hospital and pronounced deceased. Next of kin notification has not been made at this time. The officer was not injured and will be placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation. The Dallas Police Department is conducting a joint investigation with the District Attorney\u2019s Office. This investigation is ongoing and we will release additional details as they become available and it is appropriate to do so. I have no idea how you can enter an apartment mistakenly. Does Guyger leave her door unlocked? Furthermore, The Dallas News reports: Jean, who lived on the fourth floor of the South Side Flats in the Cedars, was home alone when Guyger mistook his apartment for hers, the affidavit says. Guyger lived on the third floor, directly beneath his apartment, and mistakenly parked on the fourth floor after finishing a shift at the Dallas Police Department, the affidavit says. When she arrived at Jean's door, Guyger entered a unique door key with an electronic chip into the keyhole, the affidavit says. The door was already ajar, so the force of pushing the key inside opened the door, according to the affidavit. The affidavit says the apartments' \"respective interior floorplans are in most ways identical or extremely similar.\" The apartment was dark and when she saw \"a large silhouette,\" Guyger thought she was being burglarized, the affidavit says. The affidavit says Guyger drew her gun, \"gave verbal commands that were ignored\" and fired twice. Jean was struck once in the torso. Guyger then called 911 from her cellphone and started performing first aid. She turned on the lights, then went to the front door again and realized the apartment wasn't hers, the affidavit says. She told the 911 operator as well as responding officers that she thought she was at her apartment when she shot Jean, according to the affidavit. Ok, some of this seems plausible, but I still am left wondering about the door being ajar. Is this something people are prone to do at 1o o'clock at night in Dallas? In any case, we all know that any of us who did the same thing would have immediately been taken into custody. This was not the case with Guyger, though one officer close to her said, \"she is devastated.\" Knowing this provoked outrage across the nation over the weekend. In fact, this is not her first shooting. As a four-year veteran of the force, she was also involved in the shooting of another suspect in 2017. The Dallas News reported: In 2017, Guyger shot 47-year-old Uvaldo Perez, who had wrestled a Taser away from her. Another officer had been in a Pleasant Grove neighborhood looking for a woman who had a warrant out for her arrest. When the officer thought he saw the woman in a car with two men in the 8300 block of Reva Street, the officer asked for backup from Guyger and another officer, according to an affidavit. One of the officers was trying to search Perez when he became combative, the affidavit said. Guyger deployed her Taser before Perez was able to take it from her. After Perez had the Taser, Guyger fired her gun once, striking him in the abdomen, the affidavit said. Neither Guyger nor the other officers were injured in the 2017 shooting. Police arrested Perez on a charge of taking a weapon from an officer, as well as charges for possession of methamphetamine, marijuana and violating his parole. In February 2018, Perez signed a plea agreement for the charge of taking an officer's weapon and was sentenced to two years in prison. The Texas Rangers are also involved in the investigation. USA Today reports that Guyger was freed on bail on Sunday after being charged with manslaughter, and faces two 20-year sentences and up to a $10,000 fine. A charge of murder may be forthcoming once the case is taken to a grand jury, according to Dallas County District Attorney Faith Johnson.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

Even John McCain is worried about Trump\u2019s CIA pick Personal Liberty Poll Exercise your right to vote. After President Donald Trump nominated Gina Haspel to head the Central Intelligence Agency Tuesday, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said Americans need answers about her past involvement in state sponsored torture programs. As I noted earlier today, Haspel\u2019s long career at the CIA spanned the years of torture carried out under the George W. Bush White House. A 2013 Washington Post report on the new CIA head called her role in the torture programs of that era \u201cextensive\u201d and noted that at one point she ran a CIA \u201cblack site\u201d in Thailand where torture occurred. In a lengthy statement following Haspel\u2019s nomination, McCain expressed big concerns about what it means for the agency\u2019s future, saying: During his own confirmation proceedings for Director of the CIA, Mike Pompeo repeatedly committed that he would comply with the law that applies the Army Field Manual\u2019s interrogation requirements to all U.S. agencies, including the CIA. The American people now deserve the same assurances from Gina Haspel, whose career with the agency has intersected with the program of so-called \u2018enhanced interrogation techniques\u2019 on a number of occasions. The torture of detainees in U.S. custody during the last decade was one of the darkest chapters in American history. Ms. Haspel needs to explain the nature and extent of her involvement in the CIA\u2019s interrogation program during the confirmation process. I know the Senate will do its job in examining Ms. Haspel\u2019s record as well as her beliefs about torture and her approach to current law. In the aftermath of the September 11th attacks, our government squandered precious moral authority in a futile effort to produce intelligence by means of torture. We are still dealing with the consequences of that desperately misguided decision. Current U.S. law is clear in banning enhanced interrogation techniques. Any nominee for Director of the CIA must pledge without reservation to uphold this prohibition, which has helped us to regain our position of leadership in the struggle for universal human rights\u2014the struggle upon which this country was founded, and which remains its highest aspiration.

Viktor Orban, who openly professes the Reformed faith of Christianity, told an audience at the Royal Castle in Budapest, \u201cChristianity is Europe\u2019s last hope.\u201d He continued by stating that mass immigration, especially from Africa, \u201cour worst nightmares can come true. The West falls as it fails to see Europe being overrun.\u201d Reuters reports: Hungarian leader Viktor Orban called on Sunday for a global alliance against migration as his right-wing populist Fidesz party began campaigning for an April 8 election in which it is expected to win a third consecutive landslide victory. Popular at home but increasingly at odds politically and economically with mainstream European Union peers, Orban has thrived on external controversy, including repeated clashes with Brussels and lately the United Nations. Those conflicts, mostly centered on migration since people fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East and Africa flooded into Europe in 2015, have intensified as the elections approach and Orban poses as a savior of Europe\u2019s Christian nations. One thing to note is that Christianity is not Europe's \"last hope,\" it's the world's \"only hope.\" In speaking of the influx of Muslim migrants into Europe, Orban sees it as destroying the culture of Europe and referred to it as an \u201cimmigrant zone, a mixed population world that heads in a direction different from ours.\u201d Orban then called out the traitors in the midst of Europe who want to push Hungary to accept Muslim invaders. \u201cAbsurd as it may sound the danger we face comes from the West, from politicians in Brussels, Berlin and Paris,\u201d he told the crowd to applause. \u201cOf course we will fight, and use ever stronger legal tools. The first is our \u2018Stop Soros\u2019 law.\u201d Orban has seen the influence of George Soros and his organizations in Hungary and has openly criticized it and Soros, calling Soros a \"public enemy.\" He also said that Soros has \"ruined\" millions of lives via his \"mafia network.\" Reuters adds: Soros, for his part, compared Orban unfavorably to both the Nazis and the Communists, saying his rule evoked dark tones from the 1930\u2019s \u2014 when Hungary was allied with Nazi Germany \u2014 and was more oppressive than Cold War Soviet occupation. Orban has tightened the screws on non-government organizations, particularly ones funded by Soros, and attempted to close a prominent Soros-founded university. Attributing to Soros a recent United Nations plan on creating a global blueprint to handle the migration crisis, Orban said he anticipated that powerful allies would help him prevent the U.N. from greasing the wheels of migration. \u201cSoros has antagonized not only us but also England, President Trump and Israel too,\u201d Orban said. \u201cEverywhere he wants to get migration accepted. It won\u2019t work. We are not alone and we will fight together \u2026 and we will succeed.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t think the fight is hopeless, on the contrary, we are winning,\u201d Orban said. \u201cThe V4 is firm, Croatia has come around, Austria has turned in the patriotic direction, and in Bavaria the CSU has created a resistance.\u201d The fight isn't hopeless for those whose hope is in the Lord and will stay the course. I wish Orban and those who support him success!\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

            "question": "Which of the following tactics is used in the following text?\n\nArticle: America's Immigration Voice. Kritarch Patti Saris thinks she runs immigration policy, right down to how many times someone can have their case reviewed, though she seems confused as to who will do the reviewing of those cases. At issue is a large group of Indonesian Chinese Christians who fled a pogrom in Indonesia directed against them in the 1990s. The Chinese generally filed asylum applications after arriving in the United States, and, importantly, not at an American embassy or consulate in Indonesia or nearby. All were relatively wealthy and had or obtained tourist visas to the United States. This is important as most actual \"refugees\" drop everything to flee their homelands if they are under threat of death. Tellingly, these asylum applicants were the elite of Indonesian society, because their higher average IQ, than the rather dull Indonesians. 87 is the average Indonesian IQ , and note that average includes the higher average Chinese, so the locals really are a dull lot. This is important in that while there was anti-Chinese and anti-Christian violence, the non-Chinese Christians mostly stuck around, though the Chinese used tourist and student visas to come to the United States in a leisurely manner, taking time to either bring or otherwise secure their wealth in Indonesia. In any event, the persecution was limited in time and duration as the local elite know they need the Chinese to run the economy and to avoid Red China intervening on behalf of their fellow ethnics. In the United States, these Chinese went through the liberal asylum process, but did not manage to fool even the credulous \"judges\" at the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), the immigration courts. Fast forward to the Obama Regime Administrative Amnesty , where despite outstanding deportation orders, these illegal aliens, among millions of others, are allowed to remain, and then given employment authorization as well. Fortunately, elections have consequences, and the Obama Regime Administrative Amnesty, or parts of it, came to an inglorious end. And end it was for this particular lot of illegal aliens. But Kritarch Patti Saris was having none of the immigration laws of the United States. She thought she was decider-in-chief on who gets deported. And all on the flimsy excuse that the aliens need another bite at the apple, despite the clear fact that the Indonesian government had long ago quashed the ethnic riots directed against the market dominant minority of Chinese and the religious motivated violence against Christians. While there are a couple of provinces in Indonesia that impose Sharia law on Muslims, most non-Muslims are exempt. As moderates go, Indonesia is about as close as it gets to moderate Muslims. Mostly because the country would not last long without an outside high IQ elite to run the country. Before it was the high IQ Dutch, now it's the Chinese. Remember, an 87 IQ is just about retarded. A federal judge on Monday ordered U.S. immigration officials to delay any efforts to deport 51 Indonesians living illegally in New Hampshire so the group can have time to argue that changing conditions in that country would make it dangerous to return... Federal law gives authority over immigration matters to the executive branch, not the courts. Chief U.S. District Judge Patti Saris in Boston found she had authority to ensure the Indonesians have a chance to argue that conditions in their home country had deteriorated significantly enough to reopen their cases for trying to stay in the United State. She worried that without the order, ICE officials could deport some of the Indonesians covered by the suit, at which time they would lose the opportunity to have their cases reopened. [Judge Orders U.S. To Delay Deporting Indonesians In Immigration Fight, by Scott Malone, Reuters, November 27, 2017] Kritarch Saris thought she knew better and has been running a deliberate campaign to prevent the deportation of these Chinese illegal aliens. And now she has gone full rogue, prohibiting the deportation of all these illegal aliens who already had their day in immigration court.Saris appears to be making up immigration law and procedure on the fly, as her order appears to not understand either the EOIR process or immigration law. \u201cThe government shall inform the court whether petitioners, who are not detained, will have access to emergency procedures if they must file their original motions to reopen,\u201d Saris wrote. This makes no sense in English, much less in the established procedures in the EOIR. The aliens have no emergency, there are no emergency procedures, and their original motions to reopen were denied for lack of legal basis in law or any changed conditions in the country they are being deported to that would avail them of another claim. Indonesia is more hospitable to Chinese Christians today than the short period in the 90s when there was a problem. But basically, Saris wants the illegal aliens the opportunity to submit another asylum application, and benefit by the years it will take to adjudicate those claims. Basically Saris wants these illegals to never leave. That, of course is not her role. The only claim they have before a Federal court is if they got the due process that Congress gave those illegal aliens. And they did, they filed for asylum, had a hearing and appeals, and lost. With the legislative fight over DACA, the Trump Administration needs to include legislative language including more restrictions on kritarchs who want to make American immigration policy, as well as other reforms to lower legal immigration, build the wall, and deport illegals here. Or impeachment, or both.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

From shooter Paddock\u2019s check-in date and the existence of a second person in his room, to possible connections to a terrorist organization, as well as the the actual timeline of events, everything being disseminated by law enforcement and the mainstream media should now come under public scrutiny. In the last 24 hours the Sheriff\u2019s Department has significantly revised the event timeline and a key incident involving the shooting of a Mandalay Bay security guard. Originally, as highlighted by The Daily Sheeple, the security guard was hailed as being responsible for preventing the shooter from continuing his massacre because he interrupted him in the middle of the attack. As it turns out, security guard Jesus Campos was actually shot BEFORE Paddock opened fire on the concert crowd below his 32nd floor hotel suite. As part of the constantly changing story, officials are now saying that police officers who rushed to the hotel room when the shooting began didn\u2019t know a hotel security guard had been shot \u201cuntil they met him in the hallway after exiting the elevator,\u201d Lombardo said. The security guard, Jesus Campos, was struck in the leg as the gunman, from behind his door, shot into the hallway on the 32nd floor. Paddock apparently detected Campos via surveillance cameras he set up outside his hotel suite, police have said. Paddock shot the guard at 9:59 p.m. local time, Lombardo said, shortly before raining down bullets on the Route 91 Harvest festival in an attack that began at 10:05 p.m. and lasted 10 minutes. Police officers found Campos when they arrived on the floor. And Campos did not summon police to the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel, according to the timeline recently updated by the authorities. What\u2019s also incredibly interesting, is that eyewitnesses claim to have seen security guards chasing another security guard in the minutes leading up to the massacre. The hotel guest in the room next to Paddock also saw \u201cmultiple gunmen.\u201d The Full Report: The Ever-Changing Vegas Narrative: Gunman Shot Security Guard Before Massacre As of today, here is the revised timeline, as outlined by the Los Angeles Times: The new timeline has left investigators and researchers with new questions, two of which are extremely important: What happened during the 6 minutes between Campos being shot and Paddock opening fire, and why weren\u2019t the police rushing to the scene immediately? Why did shooter Stephen Paddock stop shooting? Paddock had already shot the security guard, waited six minutes before opening fire on the concert crowd, and then shot for a full ten minutes. Police didn\u2019t arrive for two additional minutes after the shooting stopped \u2013 which is a full 18 minutes from the moment Campos was initially hit. Moreover, did he stop shooting because he was planning his escape from the 32nd floor? Or is it possible that Paddock was rushed and in a state of panic? According to links and information shared by Thomas Wictor and a timeline assessment by Twitter user Mr. Alex, the plausibility of Paddock accidentally killing himself amid the confusion, adrenaline and panic is quite high: Latest LV Sheriff: Saying they still don\u2019t know why he stopped shooting. @drawandstrike theory looking plausiblehttps://t.co/CQF3MZLHaN \u2014 Mr Alex ??? (@New_England_) October 10, 2017 While we may never know the exact circumstances surrounding what transpired in the shooter\u2019s hotel room, the information being released not just by law enforcement, but witnesses to the event who recorded hundreds of cumulative hours of video and audio, now calls the entirety official story into question.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

More from the Washington Times: Sen. Dianne Feinstein, California Democrat, has championed Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s #MeToo accuser, but Juanita Broaddrick says the senator never showed any interest in her 1999 rape allegation against President Bill Clinton. Ms. Feinstein was elected in 1992, making her one of the few remaining senators who served during independent counsel Kenneth Starr\u2019s investigation into Mr. Clinton\u2019s affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. \u201cIt\u2019s absurd,\u201d Ms. Broaddrick said Wednesday on Fox News. \u201cNot one Democrat would look at my deposition with the independent counsel. Oh my gosh, they did not want to know about it.\u201d She pointed to the discrepancy between Democratic lack of interest in her case and the party\u2019s outrage over allegations of sexual assault leveled last week against Mr. Kavanaugh. \u201cOh, it makes me go back to 1999, when Dianne Feinstein, along with every other Democrat, refused to read my deposition to the independent counsel,\u201d said Ms. Broaddrick told Fox\u2019s Laura Ingraham on Monday. \u201cThey would have nothing to do with it.

Juan Carlos Cruz, a victim of cleric Fernando Karadima in the 1980s, accused fellow priest Juan Barros of witnessing the abuse and doing nothing. The Pope caused outrage after a visit to Chile last month by defending Bishop Barros, who was made a bishop in 2015. The Vatican refused to comment on the letter when approached by BBC News. Pope Francis has said in the past that dealing with abuse is vital for the Church's credibility and perpetrators must face \"sanctions\". What allegations does the letter make? Mr Cruz sent the text of his letter (written in Spanish) to BBC News, showing it was addressed personally to Pope Francis and dated 3 March 2015. That was more than two weeks before the bishop's ordination in the south Chilean city of Osorno, an event dramatically disrupted by hundreds of protesters accusing Bishop Barros of covering up Karadima's sex attacks on young boys. The bishop has denied ever knowing about \"the serious abuses\" committed by Karadima, who was never prosecuted in Chile because so much time had passed but was convicted and sentenced by the Vatican to a lifetime of \"penance and prayer\". \"Holy Father, I decided to write this letter to you because I'm tired of fighting, crying and suffering,\" Mr Cruz writes. \u00a9 AFP Cardinal O'Malley (centre) accompanied the Pope in Latin America \"Our story is well known and there's no point reminding you of it, except to tell you of the horror of having experienced this abuse and how I wanted to kill myself.\" In his letter, he also attaches the full text of a previous letter written a month earlier to the Vatican's top diplomat in Chile, Archbishop Ivo Scapolo. In that letter, Mr Cruz accuses Bishop Barros of \"doing all the dirty work of Fernando Karadima\", and describes the abuse he suffered and which Bishop Barros allegedly witnessed. \"When we were in a room with Karadima and Juan Barros, if he [Barros] wasn't kissing Karadima, he watched as one of us, the youngest, was touched by Karadima and forced to give him kisses,\" he writes. \"Karadima would say to me: 'Put your mouth next to mine and stick out your tongue.' He'd stick out his and kiss us with his tongue. Juan Barros witnessed all of this on countless occasions, not just in my case but in the case of others as well.\" Addressing himself to Pope Francis, Mr Cruz says: \"Holy Father, Juan Barros says he saw nothing and yet, there are dozens of us who can testify to the fact that not only was he present when Karadima abused us, but that he, too, kissed Karadima and they touched each other.\" He concludes the letter with this appeal: \"Please Holy Father, don't be like the others. There are so many of us who despite everything think that you can do something. I treasure my faith, it's what sustains me, but it is slipping away from me.\" Hasn't the Pope already apologised? \u00a9 AFP Karadima was only punished by the Vatican The remarks that the Pope had made in January that caused such offence were: \"The day they bring me proof against Bishop Barros, then I will speak. There is not a single piece of proof against him. Everything is slander. Is this clear?\" The Pope later apologised for hurting victims' feelings \"without meaning to\" but continued to insist there was \"no evidence\" against the bishop. \"In Barros's case, it was studied,\" he said. \"It was restudied. And there is no evidence... I don't have evidence to convict.\" How far did the letter get? \u00a9 Reuters Bishop Barros (centre) was greeted by angry protesters at his ordination Members of the Pope's own Commission for the Protection of Minors, set up in 2014 as part of efforts to counter sex abuse by clergy, have told the Associated Press they hand-delivered the letter to Francis's top adviser on sex abuse, Cardinal Sean O'Malley, in April 2015. A photo in the AP report shows Marie Collins, a member of the commission at the time, handing the letter to the cardinal. \"When we gave him the letter for the Pope, he assured us he would give it to the Pope and speak of the concerns,\" she told AP. \"And at a later date, he assured us that that had been done.\" Mr Cruz told the BBC that Cardinal O'Malley had called him later in 2015 to say he had given the letter to the Pope. Cardinal O'Malley, whose spokesman referred requests for comment to the Vatican, has earned respect for his work in tackling sex abuse by clergy in Boston. Cardinal O'Malley's disgraced predecessor, the late Cardinal Bernard Law, had moved paedophile priests between parishes rather than addressing victims' claims. In an unusual step, Cardinal O'Malley openly criticised the Pope last month for his initial remarks in Chile, saying he had left victims feeling abandoned. Pope Francis announced last week he was sending the Vatican's top expert on sexual abuse, Archbishop Charles Scicluna, to Chile to investigate the accusations against Bishop Barros.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

Why yes, yes, he did! Not only that but it appears the MBFC doesn't know the documented history of CNN's complete fabrication of \"news,\" telling stories that never happened. MBFC isn't qualified to comment on the subject. It isn't just MBFC though. Newcomer NewsGuard also covers for CNN. This is supposed to be an outlet, at least what I was told in email and phone communication, that is simply to determine transparency of websites. Instead, they not only do that, but they go on to do far more than that. In rating CNN, NewsGuard posts this nonsense. I'm sure NewsGuard, Yemile Bucay, Anna-Sophie Harling and Amy Westfeldt need to update this in the light of the obvious lies and editing of the Acosta video and decades of documented, outright lies and propaganda by the Clown News Network, but you can't expect real transparency from an outlet like Newsguard whose writers aren't transparent about their own political bias, can you? Nope, you can't, and you can't expect it when some of those writers write for other publications that don't measure up to NewsGuard's standards either. The reason this little incident shouldn't be let go of so soon is that it is one of the clearest demonstrations of the media's bias, which we all have, lies and propaganda. It should be used over and over in article after article to remind people about the total dishonesty and complete disregard for reporting the facts by outlets such as CNN and to not blindly trust self-proclaimed fact-checkers who will not tell you the truth either. CNN has lost its mind to the point that they are suing over Acosta losing his press pass. He was their inside boy, after all. But the real irony here is that the media labeled Paul Joseph Watson and Infowars as \"conspiracy theorists\" and yet, PJW has exposed their blatant conspiracy to smear President Trump, Sarah Sanders and the White House aide. And Jim Acosta believes he and CNN deal with facts and Infowars doesn't. Yeah, right! I'm sorry Jim, I can't hear\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

How else to describe the decision by Big Brother USA and junior sidekick South Korea to stage major air force exercises on North Korea\u2019s border. The prickly North Koreans had a fit, of course, as always when the US flexes its muscles on their borders. Continuing South and North Korean peace talks scheduled this week were cancelled by the furious North Koreans. The much ballyhooed Singapore summit between US President Donald Trump and North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong-un is now threatened with cancellation or delay. Who can blame the North Koreans for blowing their tops? As Trump administration mouthpieces were gabbing about peace and light, the US Air Force was getting ready to fly B-52 heavy bombers and F-22 Raptor stealth fighters around North Korea\u2019s borders and missile-armed subs lurked at sea. This provocation was the first of two major spring military exercises planned by the US and its reluctant South Korean satrap. In case North Korea failed to get the message, the second exercise is code-named \u2018Maximum Thunder.\u2019 American Raj: Liberati... Eric Margolis Best Price: $5.99 Buy New $45.86 (as of 09:30 EDT - Details) And this right after Trump and his neocon minions reneged on the sensible nuclear treaty with Iran. In a policy one could call \u2018eat sand and die,\u2019 Trump demanded that Iran not only give up any and all nuclear capacity (Iran has no nukes), but also junk its non-nuclear armed medium range missiles, stop backing the Palestinians, Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen, roll over and be good, don\u2019t do anything to upset Israel, and pull out of Syria. In short, a total surrender policy leading to future regime change. Hardly an encouragement for North Korea. North Korea was right on target when it accused arch-neocon John Bolton of trying to sabotage the peace deal. In 2005-2006, Bolton served as the Bush administration\u2019s ambassador to the UN. He established a tradition for the post of being anti-Muslim, pro-Israel and anti-Russian, a policy continued to this day by the current US UN rep, loud-mouthed neocon Nikki Haley. In the 2005-2006 period, after years of negotiations, the US and North Korea were close to a nuclear/peace deal. Enter John Bolton. He succeeded in sabotaging the US-North Korea deal. Why? Because Bolton, as an arch neocon, was fanatically pro-Israel and feared that North Korea might provide nuclear technology to Israel\u2019s foes. As usual with the neocons, Israel\u2019s interests came before those of the United States. Trump\u2019s newly named Secretary of State, Michael Pompeo, is also an ardent neocon. Last week, Bolton went onto US TV and actually suggested North Korea might follow the course set by Libya, of all places. Libya\u2019s then ruler, Muammar Kadaffi, bought some nuclear equipment from Pakistan so he could hand it over to the US as a gesture of cooperation after the Bush administration invaded Iraq. The handover was done with much fanfare, then the US, France and Britain attacked Libya and overthrew Kadaffi. The hapless Libyan leader was eventually murdered by French agents. War at the Top of the ... Eric Margolis Best Price: $2.60 Buy New $24.57 (as of 09:00 EDT - Details) Is this what Bolton has in mind for North Korea? The Northerners certainly seemed to think so. Some wondered if Bolton and perhaps Pompeo were trying to sabotage the North Korea deal. Or were at least being incredibly obtuse and belligerent. Was Trump involved in this intrigue? Hard to tell. But he can\u2019t be happy. His minions and bootlickers are promoting Trump for the Nobel Prize \u2013 rather ahead of events. Or was the US military rattling its sabers and trying to protect its huge investments in North Asia? The Pentagon takes a dim view of the proposed Korean nuclear accords. The burst of sweetness and light coming from Pyongyang just sounds too good to be true. Veteran Korea observers, this writer included, find it hard to believe Kim Jong-un will give up his nuclear weapons, particularly after seeing Trump\u2019s deceit in dealing with Iran and Kadaffi\u2019s murder. Speaking of de-nuclearization, why does North Korea not demand that the US get rid of its nuclear weapons based in South Korea, Okinawa, Guam and with the 7th Fleet? Many are targeted on North Korea. US nuclear weapons are based on Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean. Others are secretly based in Japan. Why not demand the US pull out all its 28,500 troops in South Korea and some 2,000 military technicians at air bases? Conclusively halt those spring and fall military maneuvers that raise the threat of war. End the trade embargo of North Korea that amounts to high level economic warfare. Establish normal diplomatic relations. Pyongyang has not even begun to raise these issues. Smiles and hugs are premature.

            "question": "Which of the following tactics is used in the following text?\n\nArticle: Pope admits Catholic Church has \u2018long ignored\u2019 problem of child abuse VATICAN CITY \u2014 Pope Francis on Monday asked forgiveness for child abuse crimes and cover-ups within the Catholic Church, admitting that the pain of victims \u201cwas long ignored, kept quiet or silenced.\u201d The strongly worded statement came ahead of an Aug. 25-26 papal pilgrimage to Ireland, one of the countries rocked by clergy sex abuse scandals, and followed an expose of pedophile priests in the U.S. \u201cThe heart-wrenching pain of these victims, which cries out to heaven, was long ignored, kept quiet or silenced,\u201d Francis said in a Letter to the People of God, a rarely-issued address to the world\u2019s 1.3 billion Catholics. On Aug. 17, a Pennsylvania grand jury report, based on hidden archives of the U.S. church, named 301 priests from the state as credibly accused child sex abusers and accused church leaders of a systematic cover-up of their crimes. The report \u201cdetailed the experiences of at least a thousand survivors, victims of sexual abuse, the abuse of power and of conscience at the hands of priests over a period of approximately seventy years,\u201d Francis acknowledged. \u201cIt is essential that we, as a Church, be able to acknowledge and condemn, with sorrow and shame, the atrocities perpetrated by consecrated persons, clerics, and all those entrusted with the mission of watching over and caring for those most vulnerable,\u201d he said. \u201cLet us beg forgiveness for our own sins and the sins of others,\u201d he added. In the run-up to Francis\u2019 visit to Ireland, the head of the Irish Catholic Church, Archbishop Eamon Martin, said he expected the pope to meet with victims of clergy sex abuse and to promise effective remedies. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what his words will be and I\u2019m not sure that a simple apology is what survivors of abuse want,\u201d Martin said in a BBC interview. \u201cIf he expresses an apology, it needs to be more than \u2018we\u2019re sorry,\u2019\u201d he added. In his letter, Francis repeated a famous 2005 quote by his predecessor Benedict XVI, who, a month before being elected pope, lamented \u201chow much filth\u201d there was in the Catholic Church. \u201cWith shame and repentance, we acknowledge as an ecclesial community that we were not where we should have been, that we did not act in a timely manner, realizing the magnitude and the gravity of the damage done to so many lives. We showed no care for the little ones; we abandoned them,\u201d Francis said. \u201cLooking back to the past, no effort to beg pardon and to seek to repair the harm done will ever be sufficient. Looking ahead to the future, no effort must be spared to create a culture able to prevent such situations from happening, but also to prevent the possibility of their being covered up and perpetuated,\u201d he added. Colm O\u2019Gorman, an Irish abuse survivor who founded One in Four, the main survivors\u2019 group in Ireland, commented on Twitter that the pope offered \u201cMuch stronger language than ever used before.\u201d But O\u2019Gorman added: \u201c(The pope) begs for forgiveness, but still does not admit or own the deliberate policy of cover up designed & implemented by the #Vatican.\u201d Like his predecessor, Francis has promised \u201czero tolerance\u201d on child abuse, but scandals have kept recurring in several parts of the world \u2014 including in Australia recently. In January, the pope was accused of insensitivity and tone-deafness after insisting, during a visit to Chile, that local abuse survivors had no \u201cproof\u201d against a bishop who allegedly witnessed abuse and failed to report it. Following an outcry, Francis apologized for his remarks, held private meetings with victims at the Vatican, and, after envoys he sent to Chile backed up victims\u2019 claims, the entire leadership of the Chilean Catholic church tendered their resignations. According to church expert John L Allen, an editor at specialized website Crux.com, the Catholic Church has a structural problem when it comes to dealing with cover up accusations. \u201cSixteen years since the crisis first erupted in the U.S., almost ten years since that happened in Ireland, and now more than five years since Francis was elected, the Catholic Church still has no credible, transparent process for handling cases when the accusation against a bishop isn\u2019t the direct commission of abuse but rather covering up someone else\u2019s crimes,\u201d Allen said in a Sunday column. \u2014 Alvise Armellini dpa \u2014\u2014\u2014 \u00a92018 Deutsche Presse-Agentur GmbH (Hamburg, Germany), Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

And it\u2019s a crisis of epic proportions. On Friday, former Puerto Rican Governor Alejandro Garc\u00eda Padilla tweeted a photo from inside a hospital, in which scrubbed-up doctors leaned over an operating table performing surgery lit only by a flashlight. According to Slate, the image quickly made the rounds on the internet; it currently has almost 9,000 retweets and many speculate that that\u2019s probably because the blurry picture feels like it\u2019s worth a good deal more than 1,000 words. It illuminates just a small sliver of the public health crisis Puerto Rico is currently facing. This is what POTUS calls a 10!

And calls for help have gone unanswered besides the few willing to travel to the devastated island privately. Senator Martin Heinrich (D-NM) along with a handful of other lawmakers are calling on the federal government to continue to provide aid to the post-apocalyptic ravaged territory. \u201cEven before Hurricanes Irma and Maria hit the U.S. territories, the islands\u2019 health care system was suffering from the ongoing economic crisis. The islands are grappling with physician shortages, Medicaid programs facing an impending funding cliff, and widespread disparities in Federal health programs\u2014and that was before hurricane season,\u201d the lawmakers stated in a letter. \u201cWe are grateful for the public health emergency declaration in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, but more can and should be done to help Americans impacted by these disasters.\u201d The senators stressed that much of the islands\u2019 power and communication networks are out and, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), it will take months before power is fully restored. Hospitals have been forced to prioritize patients, ration services, and forgo elective surgeries. The power grid\u2019s failure has caused more problems than many anticipated, like the stall of relief efforts. Without electricity, communications are non-existent too. Some 33 days after Hurricane Maria made landfall on Puerto Rico, only 23 percent of residents have electricity, according to Status.pr, which provides daily updates on basic services on the island. While there are still other problems as well, such as gas stations being slow to reopen, and roads getting badly damaged, the power grid\u2019s utter annihilation in the category 4 winds is not just a temporary inconvenience. The different ways that the lack of electricity can set off a cascade of other crises is becoming increasingly clear. A giant government-owned hospital ship, the USNS Comfort, arrived in Puerto Rico weeks ago to help out, but many people don\u2019t know about the ship. Without electricity, most cell phone towers are down. But even if communications were working, residents can\u2019t get to the port, as many of the island\u2019s roads are impassable and most are without gasoline to power a car. The ship has extensive space and equipment for trauma care and a large staff, but CNN reported that as of last Tuesday, only 33 of 250 beds were full.

Specifically, Kristian Saucier, who served a year in federal prison for taking photos of classified sections of the submarine on which he worked, argues that the same officials who meted out punishment to him for his actions chose to be lenient with Hillary Clinton in her use of a private email server and handling of classified information. His lawyer, Ronald Daigle, told Fox News on Monday that the lawsuit, which he expects to file soon in Manhattan, will name the U.S. Department of Justice, former FBI Director James Comey and former President Barack Obama as defendants, among others. \u201cThey interpreted the law in my case to say it was criminal,\u201d Saucier told Fox News, referring to prosecuting authorities in his case, \u201cbut they didn\u2019t prosecute Hillary Clinton. Hillary is still walking free. Two guys on my ship did the same thing and weren\u2019t treated as criminals. We want them to correct the wrong.\u201d Daigle said that a notice about the pending lawsuit was sent to the Department of Justice and others included in it in December. There is usually a six-month period that must lapse before the lawsuit actually is filed. \u201cWe\u2019ll highlight the differences in the way Hillary Clinton was prosecuted and how my client was prosecuted,\u201d Daigle said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeking to cast a light on this to show that there\u2019s a two-tier justice system and we want it to be corrected.\u201d While campaigning, and after taking office, Trump frequently voiced support for Saucier, who in March became the second person he pardoned. Trump often compared the Obama administration\u2019s handling of Saucier\u2019s case with that of Clinton. Saucier, who lives in Vermont, pleaded guilty in 2016 to taking photos inside the USS Alexandria while it was stationed in Groton, Connecticut, in 2009. He said he only wanted service mementos, but federal prosecutors argued he was a disgruntled sailor who had put national security at risk by taking photos showing the submarine's propulsion system and reactor compartment and then obstructed justice by destroying a laptop and camera. Saucier said that he recognized he had erred in taking the photos, which he said he wanted to show only to his family to show them where he worked. But he lashed out at Obama officials, saying that his prosecution was politically motivated, prompted by sensitivity about classified information amid the scandal involving Clinton's emails. \u201cMy case was usually something handled by military courts,\u201d he said. \u201cThey used me as an example because of [the backlash over] Hillary Clinton.\u201d Saucier, 31, said that the pardon has enabled him to pick up the pieces and rebuild his life with his wife and young daughter. A felony conviction left him scrambling to find work; he finally landed a job collecting garbage. Now, he works on design and engineering projects for an industrial boiler company. \u201cThings are starting to go in the right direction,\u201d Saucier said. \u201cI work with a group of really great people, I get to use my skills set.\u201d Because of the loss of income during his imprisonment, as well as earning below his potential when he collected garbage, he and his wife Sadie lost their home to foreclosure. Debt collectors called and his cars were repossessed. \u201cWith a pardon there\u2019s no magic wand that that gets waved and makes everything right,\u201d he said, \u201cBut I try to stay positive and look forward.\u201d He praises the pardons that Trump has granted, and takes exception at the criticism. \u201cThe Obama administration singled out Dinesh for things most people don\u2019t even get charged for,\u201d Saucier said. \u201cPresident Trump noticed that my career was exemplary and that I didn\u2019t deserve what happened to me. Conservative commentator Dinesh D'Souza, who was pardoned by Trump last week, had pleaded guilty to campaign finance fraud. Trump tweeted Thursday: \"Will be giving a Full Pardon to Dinesh D'Souza today. He was treated very unfairly by our government!\" D'Souza was sentenced in 2014 to five years of probation after he pleaded guilty to violating federal election law by making illegal contributions to a U.S. Senate campaign in the names of others.

It is mercy for the predator priests,\u201d she told EWTN\u2019s Raymond Arroyo on the February 8 episode of World Over. \u201cThere are many people who know the Pope from Argentina who have said this is classic Bergoglio to provide mercy to the predators and ask everybody else to move on,\u201d she added. (See original The World Over program segment on this issue that begins at 47 seconds into the video below) Yore, who has handled child abuse investigations and clergy abuse investigations throughout her legal career, was commenting on the latest sexual abuse case to touch the Francis papacy, in this case where the Pope appointed a bishop with a history of complicity in child sex abuse. The Pope\u2019s claim that he had never received any victim testimony regarding the complicity of Chilean Bishop Juan Barros in child sex abuse has proven to be false. \u201cThe Barros case is putting the Pope, for the first time, in the middle as a principal in a cover-up,\u201d Yore said during the interview. Yore said that not only is it now known that the Pope received a letter from one of the victims, but it is also now known that he was \u201ctold from the moment he appointed Bishop Barros in 2015 that this was a bad decision.\u201d \u201cThe Chilean Archbishop conference told him to revoke this appointment. He received petitions and letters and calls, yet, ignored them all,\u201d she said. As details continue to surface, the pontiff\u2019s professed empathy for abuse victims has come into question as well. Yore called the child sex abuse case involving infamous Chilean priest abuser Father Fernando Karadima and Bishop Juan Barros \u201ca scandal of epic proportions.\u201d The scandal signals that the Church under Francis is slipping backwards in its handling of abuse, said Yore. Yore called the example Pope Francis set in the way he handled the abuse information \u201cextremely dangerous.\u201d \u201cBut it is extremely dangerous as the head of the Catholic Church \u2014 you know, the last appeal \u2014 that this is the kind of behavior that is going to be mimicked around the world by bishops, [who will say] \u2018Well if the Pope is not going to intervene and impose zero tolerance, why should I?\u2019\u201d Reports say Pope Francis personally received the eight-page letter from the Chilean victim graphically detailing the alleged abuses by Karadima and linking Barros as having witnessed and covered up the abuse. The alleged abuse took place decades prior to Francis\u2019s 2015 appointment of Barros to the Diocese of Osorno in southern Chile. Pope Francis received the victim\u2019s letter in 2015, its author and a member of Francis\u2019s sex abuse commission have said, contradicting the Pope\u2019s recent insistence that no victims had come forward in the matter and no evidence had been produced. Francis encountered protests in Chile over his defense of Barros during his visit there last month, calling the accusations against the priest \u201ccalumny.\u201d While Francis later apologized, he persisted in defending Barros, denying that he had received any testimony himself and restating that such unproven accusations are \u201cslander.\u201d The Pope later said he would send Malta Archbishop Charles Scicluna \u2013 the former top Vatican abuse investigator - to Chile to investigate the matter. Expectations were high in 2014 when the Pope created the abuse commission. And while he has continually condemned clergy sex abuse throughout his pontificate, some have argued his actions in some serious cases don\u2019t match his tough stances on abuse. Four members of the commission had met with Cardinal O\u2019Malley in 2015, conveying their objections to Francis\u2019s 2015 appointment of Barros as bishop of Osorno. It was at the meeting with O\u2019Malley that the abuse commission representatives reportedly gave the letter to the cardinal to deliver to Francis, and O\u2019Malley later confirmed to a commission member that he had in fact personally delivered the letter to the Pope. Yore explained that the Pope has been told from the moment he appointed Barros in 2015 that it was a bad decision, between the Chilean bishops\u2019 conference, petitions, letters and calls, that were all ignored. Further, a Chilean judicial inquiry found all the victims who testified \u2014 including the letter\u2019s author Juan Carlos \u2014 to be credible, and that there was a major cover-up of the abuse by Father Karadima. Arroyo spoke with Cruz as well, who said he was \u201cincredibly frustrated\u201d when Barros was going to be appointed. He\u2019d testified about three bishops who had witnessed abuse, he said, but Barros had special significance for him because Barros\u2019 part went beyond witnessing the abuse, to violating his seal of Confession with Karadima and psychological abuse through intimidation. Cruz recounted how he and other victims had been dismissed or slandered by local Church hierarchy for numerous attempts to be heard. And he spoke about holding out hope that there would be a different response from the Pope, discussing specifics of getting the letter to the Francis via Cardinal O\u2019Malley. Cruz told Arroyo he was really hurt and felt betrayed by the Pope\u2019s comments that the accusations were slander, and there were no witnesses or evidence. \u201cTo hear him talk about us that way,\u201d Cruz said, \u201ccalling us slanderers, it was terrible because it set the clock back for so many victims.\u201d Scicluna will be meeting with Cruz, who said he hopes other abuse survivors will be heard as a result of his case coming more to the forefront. \u201cThis leaves us with very\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

The father and son's 2016 imprisonment \u2014 and the armed protest at a national wildlife refuge that followed \u2014 formed a flashpoint in the ongoing dispute between cattle ranchers and the federal government over land-use rights. Story Continued Below \u201cThe Hammonds are multi-generation cattle ranchers in Oregon imprisoned in connection with a fire that leaked onto a small portion of neighboring public grazing land,\u201d the White House said in a statement. \u201c[They] are devoted family men, respected contributors to their local community, and have widespread support from their neighbors, local law enforcement, and farmers and ranchers across the West. \u201cJustice is overdue for Dwight and Steven Hammond, both of whom are entirely deserving of these Grants of Executive Clemency.\u201d Dwight Hammond, 76, and Steven Hammond, 49, were originally convicted in 2012 after an Oregon jury found they had committed arson on federal lands a decade earlier. The Hammonds asserted they were taking preventative measures to protect their property from wildfires and invasive plants; the federal government maintained they were attempting to mask illegal deer hunting, among other things.

After a sympathetic federal judge ruled the 5-year mandatory minimum sentence unconstitutional, the father and son walked away with sentences of three months and one year respectively. Prosecutors appealed, and the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals later reversed the decision, resentencing the men to 5 years apiece (a move the White House statement called \"unjust\"). The duo\u2019s subsequent arrival at a California prison to complete the remainder of their sentences triggered a 300-person march and later, a protest at Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. There, armed occupiers \u2014 including Ammon Bundy, whose father Cliven Bundy participated in a similar 2014 standoff \u2014 faced off with federal agents for 41 days in dispute of the jail time, which they saw as punishment for the Hammond family\u2019s refusal to sell the government its land. \u201cWe felt we had exhausted all prudent measures,\u201d Bundy said in a news conference at the time. \u201cDo we allow this to go on, or do we make a stand?\u201d The Hammonds\u2019 attorneys had sought clemency from former President Barack Obama, The Oregonian reported. But the appeal did not gain much traction until Trump took office. \"I have a sense that things are moving forward and I have faith in our president,\u201d Susie Hammond, the wife and mother of the imprisoned ranchers, told The Oregonian last month. \u201cIf anyone is going to help them, he'd be the one.\" This article tagged under: Pardons Donald Trump Oregon\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

Lawyers for Assange and Manafort denounced the report as false. If confirmed, the report Tuesday would suggest a direct connection between the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks, which released tens of thousands of emails stolen by Russian spies during the 2016 election. The campaign seized on the emails to undermine Trump\u2019s rival, Hillary Clinton. The Guardian, which did not identify the sources for its reporting, said that Manafort met with Assange \u201caround March 2016\u201d \u2014 the same month that Russian hackers began their all-out effort to steal emails from the Clinton campaign. In a statement, Manafort called the story \u201ctotally false and deliberately libelous\u201d and said he was considering his legal options against the Guardian. \u201cI have never met Julian Assange or anyone connected to him,\u201d Manafort said. \u201cI have never been contacted by anyone connected to WikiLeaks, either directly or indirectly. I have never reached out to Assange or WikiLeaks on any matter.\u201d Assange\u2019s Ecuadorean lawyer, Carlos Poveda, said the Guardian report was false. And WikiLeaks said on Twitter that it was \u201cwilling to bet the Guardian a million dollars and its editor\u2019s head that Manafort never met Assange.\u201d It later tweeted that Assange had instructed his lawyers to sue the Guardian for libel. The Guardian cited two unidentified sources as saying Manafort first met Assange at the embassy in 2013, a year after Assange took refuge there to avoid being extradited to Sweden over sex crime allegations. The Guardian said Manafort returned there in 2015 and 2016 and said its sources had \u201ctentatively dated\u201d the final visit to March. The newspaper added that Manafort\u2019s visit was not entered into the embassy\u2019s log book and cited a source as saying Manafort left after 40 minutes. There was no detail on what might have been discussed. The Trump campaign announced Manafort\u2019s hire on March 29, 2016, and he served as the convention manager tasked with lining up delegates for the Republican National Convention. He was promoted to campaign chairman in May 2016.

            "question": "Which of the following tactics is used in the following text?\n\nArticle: Israel Takes On the Shia Crescent Despite Israel's repeated warnings, Barack Obama's reckless appeasement of the Iranian regime has enabled its rise as a hegemonic threat in the Middle East region as well as a threat to international peace and security. In 2009, Obama turned his back on millions of dissidents in the streets of Tehran and other Iranian cities, who were peacefully protesting the rigged election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as president. In 2011, Obama precipitously removed the remaining U.S. combat troops from Iraq, giving rise to ISIS\u2019s re-emergence in Iraq from its bases in Syria. The radical Shiite Iranian regime purported to come to the \u201crescue\u201d of both countries from the Sunni terrorists, turning Iraq into a virtual vassal state of the largest state sponsor of terrorism in the process. Obama's disastrous nuclear deal with Iran legitimized Iran's path to eventually becoming a nuclear-armed state, while immediately filling its coffers with billions of dollars to fund its aggression. Meanwhile, Syria has become ground zero for Iran's execution of its regional ambitions, which is to establish its Shiite Crescent connecting with its allies, including Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. This plan has included the establishment of a land route that Iranian-backed militias secured in June, beginning on Iran\u2019s border with Iraq and running across Iraq and Syria all the way to Syria\u2019s Mediterranean coast. This road makes Iran\u2019s job easier in supplying arms by land, as well as by air and sea, to prop up Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime and to equip Iran\u2019s own forces fighting inside of Syria in support of Assad. This helps explain why Iran has placed so much importance on helping the Syrian regime establish control over the Deir ez-Zor area in eastern Syria, near the Iraqi border. \u201cEverything depends now on the Americans\u2019 willingness to stop this,\u201d said an Iraqi Kurdish official who was quoted in a New Yorker article. However, U.S.-led coalition forces apparently have done next to nothing to stop this major advance in Iran\u2019s Shiite Crescent expansion. \u201cObama ran down our options in Syria so thoroughly, by the time this administration took over,\u201d said Andrew Tabler, senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. \u201cThe Iranian influence is spreading because they are so heavily involved in regime activities,\u201d Tabler added. \u201cIt\u2019s a new monster.\u201d Furthermore, Iran has funded and armed its terrorist proxy Hezbollah, which has sent its militia from its home base of Lebanon to fight alongside Assad's forces. And Iran has used Syria as a transit point for shipment of sophisticated rockets to Hezbollah in Lebanon for future use against Israeli population centers. Despite the fact that Hezbollah has American blood on its hands, the U.S.-led coalition has chosen not to do anything about Hezbollah\u2019s presence in Syria, bought and paid for by Iran. While Israel chose not to take sides in Syria's civil war with military intervention of its own, it has bombed weapons storage facilities and convoys inside Syria for its own protection. Just recently, on September 7th, Israeli jets struck a Syrian weapons facility near Masyaf, which was reported to have been used for the production of chemical weapons and the storage of missiles. Israel will also do what is necessary to repel Iranian-backed forces if they edge too close to areas near the Golan Heights, shrinking the buffer between Israel and Iranian controlled territories. However, such tactical measures may not be enough to thwart Iran\u2019s larger ambitions. In light of intelligence reports that Assad may be ready to invite Iran to set up military bases in Syria, Israeli leaders have concluded that they cannot wait until the Trump administration decides to deal more forcefully with Iran's growing use of Syria as a staging area for carrying out its expansionist Shiite Crescent strategy. \u201cTheir overriding concern in Syria is the free reign that all the major players there seem willing to afford Iran and its various proxies in the country,\u201d wrote Jonathan Spyer in an article for Foreign Policy. As long as nobody else is addressing the concern Iran\u2019s growing control raises in a satisfactory manner, \u201cIsrael is determined to continue addressing it on its own.\u201d At least, Israel has a more sympathetic ear in the Trump administration than it did in the Obama administration for raising its concerns about Iran\u2019s growing threat, not only to Israel but to U.S. interests in the region and beyond. President Trump\u2019s sharp denunciation of the Iranian regime during his address to the UN General Assembly represented a welcome departure from the Obama administration\u2019s milquetoast approach to Iran. As the U.S.-led coalition continues to drive ISIS from its bases of operation in Syria, the Trump administration has proclaimed its intention not to allow Iran to turn Syria into its own satellite, as Iran has essentially done in Iraq. National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster said that the \u201cso called liberation of areas by Assad\u2019s forces and Iranian proxies could actually accelerate the cycle of violence and perpetuate conflict rather than get us to a sustainable outcome.\u201d He claimed that the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cobjectives are to weaken Iranian influence across the region broadly,\u201d without discussing the means to accomplish those objectives. Whether the Trump administration follows through remains to be seen. In the meantime, Israel will have to deal with the fallout of Iran\u2019s ambitions in Syria itself.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

With the imperative to be \u201ctolerant\u201d robbing many educators of their ability to evaluate non-Western cultures critically, all too many public schools and individual teachers have proven to be susceptible to an organized campaign by U.S.-based Islamic organizations and their primary benefactor, Saudi Arabia, to present a view of Islam that whitewashes its violent history and intolerant doctrines. Many of the Islamic groups that vet American public school textbooks for the accuracy of their material on Islamic doctrine and history are Saudi-funded. They make sure that the Islamic instruction in these textbooks presents a picture of Islam that is so pristine and whitewashed that it sometimes crosses the boundary from mere pro-Muslim bias into outright Islamic proselytizing. The taboo about teaching religion in the public schools, so zealously established and guarded against Christian prayer by the ACLU and the Supreme Court over the last few decades, is increasingly set aside in American public schools, as presentations on Islam frequently cross the line between teaching facts about the religion and teaching the religion as fact. take our poll - story continues below Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?

We have seen this just recently, when Mountain Ridge Middle School in Gerrardstown, West Virginia instructed students to copy out the Islamic profession of faith (shahada), ostensibly as a calligraphy exercise. Parent Rich Penkoski recounted: \u201cI saw the assignment of writing the Shahada in Arabic. Their excuse was calligraphy. I was like, \u2018Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!\u2019 First of all, calligraphy was invented in China 3,000 years prior to Muhammad. The fact that they were trying to get my daughter to write that disturbed me. I said, \u2018That is not happening. My daughter is not doing that.\u2019 My daughter told me that if she didn\u2019t do the assignment, then she was going to get a [detention] slip.\u201d Branch contradicted Penkoski, claiming: \u201cThe teacher has told her class several times that this is a study of world religions and that she is not trying to advocate for any religion over another. She has told her class that if they had questions about religious beliefs, that those conversations should take place with their parents.\u201d He said that Christianity and Judaism were given \u201cequitable treatment\u201d in the same class. Penkoski\u2019s daughter, Brielle, however, said that the class spent much less time on Christianity and Judaism than it did on Islam. Penkoski pointed out that the accompanying exercises were also less extensive for Christianity and Judaism than they were for Islam: \u201cNotice no Bible verses, no reciting the Ten Commandments or the Lord\u2019s Prayer. [There\u2019s] no practicing writing in Hebrew as compared to the Islamic packet.\u201d This stealth proselytizing is nationwide. Last January, parents filed a federal complaint against Chatham Middle School in Chatham, New Jersey, for forcing students to watch videos that proselytized for Islam. One video, according to the complaint, describes \u201cChristians and Jews as \u2018infidels\u2019 and prais[es] Muhammad in gruesome detail for slaughtering them.\u201d Parent Libby Hilsenrath characterized the accompanying assignment as \u201creplete with biased, chastising statements encouraging the students\u2026to follow the Quran and become Muslim.\u201d Another video, according to Hilsenrath, depicts a Muslim boy teaching his non-Muslim friend about Islam, after which both go to \u201clearn how to pray.\u201d The complaint adds: \u201cDue to the fact that these doctrinal messages calling for conversion to Islam were included in video format with vivid images and text, they possess greater communicative impact and are more likely to be accepted by the students viewing them than information that is spoken in a classroom or even written in a book.\u201d These accounts are not singular. High school students in Newton, Massachusetts in October 2017, according to Fox News, \u201cpretended to be Muslims in the \u2018Islamic\u2019 city of Jerusalem as part of a class assignment.\u201d The assignment also included a pro-Palestinian, anti-Israel article. Judicial Watch Senior Investigator Bill Marshall remarked: \u201cCitizens of Newton have been waging a minor war with school officials for years now, trying to get them to use balanced curriculum in their teaching materials on the subject of Islam and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\u201d Dr. Bill Saxton, chairman of Citizens for National Security, said that the assignment was a \u201cpurposeful attempt to indoctrinate our impressionable high-schoolers with the \u2018virtues\u2019 of Islam at the expense of Christianity, Judaism and other religions.\u201d Meanwhile, Georgia parent Michelle King noted in 2016: \u201cMy daughter had to learn the Shahid and the Five Pillars of Islam, which is what you learn to convert,\u201d while not teaching Christianity or the Ten Commandments. One homework assignment in Walton County, Georgia, stated: \u201cAllah is the [blank] worshiped by Jews & Christians,\u201d with students having to fill in the blank with \u201csame God.\u201d Parent Steve Alsup added: \u201cIt seemed like half the truth to me, they didn\u2019t talk about the extreme Islamics.\u201d Kim Embry, a spokesperson for Walton County Public Schools, said revealingly: \u201cWe are teaching the same stuff that everyone else is teaching.\u201d Indeed. In 2015, students at Spring Hill Middle School in Spring Hill, Tennessee were forced as part of an assignment to write, \u201cThere is no god but Allah; Muhammad is his prophet.\u201d Mother Joy Ellis remarked: \u201cThis is a seventh grade state standard, and will be on the TCAP.

U.S. District Court Judge Timothy Kelly granted the cable news network\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction Friday that restored Acosta\u2019s White House press credential. Kelly ordered that Acosta be reinstated immediately. He did not rule on CNN\u2019s claim that the revocation of the journalist\u2019s pass violated his rights under the First Amendment. But he said the White House did not provide Acosta with due process to legally remove his pass. The ruling followed a court hearing held Wednesday in Washington, where lawyers for CNN and the White House faced off over the issue of press access. CNN had the broad support of other news organizations that believed the White House\u2019s actions posed a challenge to press freedom. \u201cWe are gratified with this result and we look forward to a full resolution in the coming days,\u201d a CNN representative said in a statement. \u201cOur sincere thanks to all who have supported not just CNN, but a free, strong and independent American press.\u201d The White House said it would abide by Kelly\u2019s ruling. \u201cToday, the court made clear there is no absolute right to access the White House. In response to the court, we will temporarily reinstate the reporter\u2019s hard pass,\u201d White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement. \u201cWe will also further develop rules and processes to ensure fair and orderly press conferences in the future. There must be decorum in the White House.\u201d Acosta\u2019s press credential was revoked by the White House on Nov. 7 after a testy exchange with President Donald Trump at a White House news conference. At one point, Acosta refused to relinquish the microphone to a White House aide who tried to retrieve it from him. It was the latest in a series of public confrontations between Acosta and Trump, who has repeatedly characterized CNN\u2019s critical coverage of him as \u201cfake news\u201d since the 2016 presidential campaign. CNN\u2019s suit filed Tuesday says the suspension of Acosta\u2019s credential violates the First Amendment\u2019s protection of free speech. It also says the way the administration revoked the pass, with no direct notice to Acosta or a written explanation detailing the decision, violated the Fifth Amendment\u2019s protection of due process and the federal Administrative Procedures Act. \u201cThis severe and unprecedented punishment is the culmination of years of hostility by President Trump against CNN and Acosta based on the contents of their reporting \u2014 an unabashed attempt to censor the press and exclude reporters from the White House who challenge and dispute the president\u2019s point of view,\u201d the suit says. Responding to the CNN suit, lawyers for the White House said the Trump administration had broad discretion to regulate access to journalists and other members of the public. \u201cIf the president wants to exclude all reporters from the White House grounds, he has the authority to do that,\u201d Deputy Assistant Attorney General James Burnham said during the hearing. \u201cThere\u2019s no First Amendment right.\u201d The White House argued that Acosta\u2019s behavior, which it described as rude and aggressive, was the reason for revoking his credential. Mark Lukasiewicz, dean of The Lawrence Herbert School of Communication at Hofstra University and a former network news executive, praised the judge\u2019s decision, which he said was not a surprise. \u201cThe White House has lots of other ways to deal with the behavior of reporters if that\u2019s their concern, but closing the gate to a news organization is not one of these ways, and it\u2019s important that the court stood up and said that,\u201d Lukasiewicz said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the first time a reporter has behaved in a way that a president doesn\u2019t like.\u201d Lukasiewicz believed CNN would reach a compromise with the White House rather than engage in a prolonged court battle. \u201cThe law and the Constitution is very clear here,\u201d he said. CNN\u2019s suit received the support of more than a dozen news organizations including Fox News, where commentators have often echoed Trump\u2019s criticisms of the network\u2019s coverage. Rival news organizations came to the defense of Fox News in 2009 when the Obama administration attempted to exclude its reporters from interviews with officials that were offered to all other outlets. Fox News commentators were President Barack Obama\u2019s harshest critics during his eight years in office, and he often complained about it in public and private. But the press credentials for its conservative-leaning network were never revoked. Fox News, The Washington Post, NBC News, The Associated Press and the Los Angeles Times are among the entities that have said they will file amicus briefs on behalf of CNN. \u2014 Stephen Battaglio Los Angeles Times \u2014\u2014\u2014 \u00a92018 Los Angeles Times, Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

            "question": "Which of the following tactics is used in the following text?\n\nArticle: Student organizers boot SNL writer from stage during standup routine for jokes deemed offensive Saturday Night Live writer and comedian Nimesh Patel was pulled from the stage by event organizers after telling jokes that were criticized as racist and homophobic during his performance at cultureSHOCK: Reclaim, an event held by Columbia Asian American Alliance on Friday night. Patel, 32, was the first Indian-American writer for SNL, and has since been nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing. Patel has previously performed on Late Night with Seth Meyers and opened for comedians such as Chris Rock. During the event, Patel\u2019s performance featured commentary on his experience living in a diverse area of New York City\u2014including a joke about a gay, black man in his neighborhood\u2014which AAA officials deemed inappropriate. Patel joked that being gay cannot be a choice because \u201cno one looks in the mirror and thinks, \u2018this black thing is too easy, let me just add another thing to it.\u2019\u201d About 30 minutes into Patel\u2019s set, members of AAA interrupted the performance, denounced his jokes about racial identities and sexual orientation, and provided him with a few moments for closing remarks. Compared to his other jokes, ones specifically targeting sexual orientation audibly receive less laughter from the crowd. Patel pushed back on the officials\u2019 remarks, and said that while he stood in solidarity with Asian American identities, none of his remarks were offensive, and he was exposing the audience to ideas that would be found \u201cin the real world.\u201d Before he could finish, Patel\u2019s microphone was cut from off-stage, and he proceeded to leave. cultureSHOCK, an annual charity showcase featuring a fashion show, productions by various student groups and a famous performer, aims to provide a platform for Asian American artistic expression and breakthrough harmful stereotypes. Neither Patel and nor AAA could immediately be reached for comment. Adam Warren, CC \u201822, was in the audience Friday night. Warren said that AAA made the right decision to remove Patel from the stage due to the nature of his jokes, which contradicted the sensitive nature of the event itself. \u201cThe message they were trying to send with the event was opposite to the jokes he was making, and using people\u2019s ethnicity as the crux of his jokes could be funny but still offensive...He definitely wasn\u2019t the most crass comedian I\u2019ve ever heard but for the event it was inappropriate,\u201d Warren said. However, audience member Elle Ferguson, BC \u201822, said that while comedians can push the boundaries of social culture, she had heard similar jokes before and did not find them offensive. \u201cWhile what some of the things that he said might have been a bit provoking to some of the audience, as someone who watches comedy a lot, none of them were jokes that I hadn\u2019t heard before and none of them were jokes that elicited such a response in my experience,\u201d Ferguson said. \u201c[AAA] should have talked to him beforehand especially because comedy is known for being ground-breaking and for pushing boundaries.\u201d For Sofia Jao, BC \u201822, problems with the performance resided not in the set, but with Patel\u2019s closing remarks. \u201cI really dislike when people who are older say that our generation needs to be exposed to the real world. Obviously the world is not a safe space but just accepting that it\u2019s not and continuing to perpetuate the un-safeness of it\u2026 is saying that it can\u2019t be changed,\u201d said Jao. \u201cWhen older generations say you need to stop being so sensitive, it\u2019s like undermining what our generation is trying to do in accepting others and making it safer.\u201d\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

Weinandy. The former head of the theological secretariat of the U.S. Bishop\u2019s conference, Fr. Weinandy has taught at both Oxford and the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome. None other than Francis appointed Fr. Weinandy to the International Theological Commission and awarded him the Pro Pontifice et Ecclesiae medal, the ecclesial equivalent of the Congressional Medal of Honor, for his work on behalf of the Pope and the Church. One of the world\u2019s most renowned theologians, Fr. Weinandy is a \u201cman of the Council\u201d and a prominent figure of the post-conciliar mainstream. Yet Fr. Weinandy\u2019s letter, sent to Francis privately last summer but predictably ignored by him\u2014along with every other private entreaty concerning his destructive activity\u2014is a withering indictment of a papacy that constitutes nothing less than a menace to the Church. The key passages (paragraph breaks added) rebuke Francis for his recklessness, his deliberate ambiguity, his fomenting of error, his sowing of disunity, his unheard-of calumnies of the faithful, and even his reduction of the faith to an ideology\u2014precisely the wrong of which he accuses orthodox Catholics: Your Holiness, a chronic confusion seems to mark your pontificate\u2026. This fosters within the faithful a growing unease \u2026. In \"Amoris Laetitia,\" your guidance at times seems intentionally ambiguous, thus inviting both a traditional interpretation of Catholic teaching on marriage and divorce as well as one that might imply a change in that teaching\u2026. To teach with such a seemingly intentional lack of clarity inevitably risks sinning against the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of truth. The Holy Spirit is given to the Church, and particularly to yourself, to dispel error, not to foster it. [Y]ou seem to censor and even mock those who interpret Chapter 8 of \"Amoris Laetitia\" in accord with Church tradition as Pharisaic stone-throwers who embody a merciless rigorism. This kind of calumny is alien to the nature of the Petrine ministry\u2026. Such behavior gives the impression that your views cannotsurvive theological scrutiny, and so must be sustained by \u201cad hominem\u201d arguments. [T]oo often your manner seems to demean the importance of Church doctrine. Again and again you portray doctrine as dead and bookish, and far from the pastoral concerns of everyday life. Your critics have been accused, in your own words, of making doctrine an ideology. But it is precisely Christian doctrine\u2026 that frees people from worldly ideologies and assures that they are actually preaching and teaching the authentic, life-giving Gospel. Those who devalue the doctrines of the Church [i.e., Francis!] separate themselves from Jesus, the author of truth\u2026 What they [i.e., Francis] then possess, and can only possess, is an ideology \u2013 one that conforms to the world of sin and death. [F]aithful Catholics can only be disconcerted by your choice of some bishops, men who seem not merely open to those who hold views counter to Christian belief but who support and even defend them. What scandalizes believers, and even some fellow bishops, is not only your having appointed such men to be shepherds of the Church, but that you also seem silent in the face of their teaching and pastoral practice\u2026. As a result, many of the faithful, who embody the \"sensus fidelium,\" are losing confidence in their supreme shepherd. [T]he Church is one body, the Mystical Body of Christ, and you are commissioned by the Lord himself to promote and strengthen her unity. But your actions and words too often seem intent on doing the opposite\u2026. You have often spoken about the need for transparency within the Church. You have frequently encouraged\u2026 all persons, especially bishops, to speak their mind and not be fearful of what the pope may think. But\u2026 what many [bishops] have learned from your pontificate is not that you are open to criticism, but that you resent it\u2026 Many fear that if they speak their mind, they will be marginalized or worse. I have often asked myself: \"Why has Jesus let all of this happen?\" The only answer that comes to mind is that Jesus wants to manifest just how weak is the faith of many within the Church, even among too many of her bishops. Ironically, your pontificate has given those who hold harmful theological and pastoral views the license and confidence to come into the light and expose their previously hidden darkness\u2026. Father Weinandy reveals that he decided to publicize this historic missive only after receiving an unmistakable sign from heaven. As he recounts here, after repeatedly \u201cbeseeching Jesus and Mary, St. Peter and all of the saintly popes who are buried there to do something to rectify the confusion and turmoil within the Church today, a chaos and an uncertainty that I felt Pope Francis had himself caused,\u201d he asked for a minutely specific sign from heaven on whether he should write the letter: that the next day he would meet someone he had not seen in a very long time, would never expect to see in Rome, and was not from the United States, Canada or Great Britain, which person would utter the particular phrase: \u201cKeep up the good writing.\u201d At lunch the next day, the sign was given. An old friend he had not seen in more than twenty years and would never have expected to meet in Rome, who is now an archbishop, appeared suddenly from between two parked cars, renewed acquaintances and, referring to one of Father Weinandy\u2019s books, said: \u201cKeep up the good writing.\u201d Writes Fr. Weinandy: \u201cI could hardly believe that this just happened in a matter of a few minutes. But there was no longer any doubt in my mind that Jesus wanted me to write something. I also think it significant that it was an Archbishop that Jesus used. I considered it an apostolic mandate.\u201d Can we doubt that\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

The latest outbreak of #BDStears comes from Dan Fishback and his supporters. The American Jewish Historical Society was caught collaborating with JVP; a radical anti-Israel hate group with links to anti-Semitism. Here's my article on the subject. The American Jewish Historical Society was founded to study and preserve Jewish history. These days it\u2019s instead partnering with Jewish Voice for Peace: an anti-Israel BDS hate group that defends anti-Semitism and which sponsored talks by an anti-Semite who accused Jews of drinking blood. Coming up in late October is \u201cThe Balfour Declaration: Support for a Jewish Homeland or Jewish State?\u201d The two speakers are Robert Herbst, the coordinator of the Westchester chapter of JVP, and Jonathan Kuttab, who advocates a one-state solution for eliminating Israel. He had tweeted, \"EU no longer considers #Hamas a terrorist group. Time for US to do same.\" In December, the AJHS will feature \u201cRubble Rubble\u201d, a play by Dan Fishback based on his trip to Israel. Fishback is a BDS supporter and a member of the JVP Artists Council. His goal is to \u201cnormalize Jewish anti-Zionism\u201d. AJHS and JVP members get discounted admission. The JVP events have been canceled That includes Fishback's Rubble and Rubble. And Dan Fishback is flooding the media with #BDStears. There's an outbreak of them at anti-Israel hate sites like the New York Times and the Forward. \"I have grown accustomed to feeling unwelcome in Jewish spaces,\" Dan Fishback whines. Him, the PLO and the KKK. \"Any Jew who opposes the Occupation \u2014 or opposes Zionism itself \u2014 knows that feeling of being shunned from the places that are supposed to shelter and nurture you: families, synagogues, community centers, arts organizations,\" Fishback continues. \"I am terrified for the Jewish people. I was raised to believe we were a people of dissent and argument. I was taught that it was important to ask difficult questions, and that it was noble to stand up for what you believed in. If our Jewish institutions \u2014 particularly the American Jewish Historical Society \u2014 cannot accommodate dissent, and effectively exclude all Jewish anti-Zionists, then they have not only lost a rapidly growing Jewish population, but they have lost a key aspect of their Jewishness.\" Let's unpack this knapsack of entitled nonsense. Anti-Israel activists like Dan Fishback are entitled to exploit Jewish spaces for their propoaganda... even while they advocate a boycott of the Jews of Israel. Previously Dan Fishback had authored an article arguing for boycotting some Israeli plays. Now he's whining that boycotting his play is a violation of Jewishness because Jews are a \"people of dissent and argument.\" But the only dissent and argument that Jews are supposed to welcome is that of people who hate the existence of Jewish nationhood. Not of Jewish nationhood itself. \"it\u2019s not that BDS is \u201ccensoring\u201d work \u2014 it\u2019s that BDS is resisting a propaganda campaign that was intentionally crafted to influence international politics,\" Dan Fishback claimed when advocating a boycott of some Israeli plays. It's not that boycotting Dan Fishback censors work. It's resistance to a propaganda campaign intended to attack the human rights of the Jewish people. It's time for the #BDStears crowd to examine their entitlement and recognize that what's good for the goose is good for the gander. Either that or they can go whine to the New York Times some more because the Jewish community won't let them burn crosses on their lawn.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

Fox News reports: The missing boy's grandfather, Siraj Wahhaj, a Muslim cleric who leads a well-known New York City mosque, told reporters he had learned from other family members that the remains were his grandson's. The imam said he did not know the cause of death. \"Whoever is responsible, then that person should be held accountable,\" Wahhaj said. A Georgia arrest warrant accused the boy's father, Siraj Ibn Wahhaj, the imam's son, of kidnapping the child. Authorities said the father at some point told his wife he wanted to perform an exorcism on the boy, who cannot walk, suffers seizures and requires constant attention because of a lack of oxygen and blood flow at birth. The imam said he was unaware of the training of the children for school shootings, but his mosque has been known to attract Islamic jihadis over the years. \"It sounds to me it sounds crazy. But I don't know,\" he said. \"I make no judgments yet because we don't know.\" Again Fox adds, \"The imam's mosque has attracted a number of radicals over the years, including a man who later helped bomb the World Trade Center in 1993.\" Mosque spokesman Ali Abdul-Karim Judan claims that the narrative is being changed because Muslims are involved and that this was nothing more than a \"domestic situation.\" \"None of the charges had anything to do with anybody teaching anybody shooting to commit acts of terrorism or to go in and shoot up any school,\" he said. \"Because it's a Muslim and the circumstances that are surrounding their situation, they want to change the narrative.\" Eleven children were found in terrible conditions in that compound. That's hardly a \"domestic situation.\" Furthermore, as I reported on Wednesday, both the Associated Press and the Atlanta Constitution-Journal reported on the training. The documents claim Siraj Ibn Wahhaj and his co-defendants conducted weapons training at the camp where they were found Friday with 11 children in allegedly \u201cthird world\u201d conditions. Wahhaj is also wanted in Clayton County in a child abduction case involving his missing son, Abdul-Ghani Wahhaj. The documents, which suggest all the adults were involved in the training, say a person serving as a foster parent caring for one of the kids revealed the details about the training. BREAKING: Court documents say man arrested at New Mexico compound was training children to commit school shootings. \u2014 The Associated Press (@AP) August 8, 2018 People can continue to put their heads in the sand all they want to because they know \"nice\" Muslim people, but the fact of the matter is that the history of Islam is anything but nice, polite, just or holy . It is a totalitarian, religious/political construct that is full of oppression. When you have those that actually believe the Koran and follow in the footsteps of the desert nomad Muhammad , then you will not find radicals, but devout Muslims. This appears to be exactly what Siraj Ibn Wahhaj and others arrested at the compound are. In either case, it is very sad that a little boy lost his life, possibly at the hands of his Islamic father and others. Justice should be served swift, and I don't mean a lengthy jail term.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

But police did not carry out a search of the property until last week, Taos County Sheriff Jerry Hogrefe said, because they did not believe they had probable cause in the case. That delay is facing scrutiny in the wake of Monday's discovery of a young boy's remains at the compound. \"They were dragging their feet. They were taking too long,\" said Tanya Badger, who with her husband, Jason, told authorities about the boy's suspected presence at the compound. \"Even if they were trying to build a case or whatnot, a child's life is at stake.\" It's not clear whether the remains are those of Abdul-Ghani Wahhaj, a child with severe medical problems who disappeared from Georgia about nine months ago. The remains were discovered in a wretched compound along with 11 starving children, authorities said. More details about the horrid compound could be revealed Wednesday when the five adults arrested from the site make their first court appearances. Authorities raided the compound in Amalia, New Mexico, on Friday as part of their search for Abdul-Ghani, whose father, Siraj Wahhaj, allegedly abducted him from Georgia in November. Neighbors raised alarm about a suspect The Badgers , whose land the compound was on, said they saw a boy they thought was Abdul-Ghani in January and February. In April, they discovered the boy was listed as missing and his father a fugitive. They reported the sightings to state and local law enforcement, but it was months before police moved in, the couple said. \"We are just beyond frustrated that they took so long,\" Tanya Badger said. New Mexico authorities had suspected the father and son might be at the compound after learning about the abduction in May, the sheriff said. But there was not enough evidence for a search warrant, and surveillance of the property didn't identify the pair there. \"I had no probable cause to go onto this property,\" Hogrefe said. \"In hindsight I wish there was, but we would not have been there lawfully.\" The sheriff said that \"they did surveillance, both ground and aerial, and photographs were shared with the family and mother of the missing boy. The boy Abdul was never identified from those photos. Moving forward we knew that there was this compound, but we had very little details about it or who was occupying it. These people just kind of (sprang) up very quickly.\" The authorities' view changed Thursday when they said they received a message about possible starving children living on the compound, and had enough probable cause to put in an affidavit for a search warrant. \"We are starving and need food and water,\" the message said, according to authorities. Authorities said it was forwarded to them but did not provide details on its origin. Compound wasn't searched thoroughly, couple say When officers executed a search warrant on the compound, they found a horrifying scene. Stacks of tires, piles of trash and plastic sheets surrounded the compound. Obscured by the junk was a trailer where the 11 children and five adults were living. The children wore dirty rags for clothing with no shoes, and were surrounded by weapons and rounds of ammunition, authorities said. \"It was the saddest living conditions and poverty I have seen,\" Hogrefe said. The father of the missing boy, Siraj Wahhaj, was arrested at the compound Friday along with his sisters Hujrah Wahhaj and Subhannah Wahhaj and two other adults -- Lucas Morten and Jany Leveille. All have been charged with abuse of the 11 children. Morten was charged with harboring a fugitive. However, the Badgers said that police did not do a thorough job searching the property. The couple said they went back over the weekend after they found out Abdul-Ghani wasn't among the 11 children discovered during the raid. Tanya and Jason Badger said they told authorities they had seen a boy they thought was Abdul-Ghani Wahhaj. They said they were surprised to see the scene was not taped off and was still largely untouched. They found two guns, ammo, tactical vests and video cameras that police initially missed, Jason Badger said. \"When we first went up there, nothing was overturned,\" he said. \"You could tell nobody had looked underneath that, nobody had looked underneath this.\" Father allegedly took boy in November Abdul-Ghani's mother, Hakima Ramzi, could not be reached after authorities announced the discovery of the remains. But hours earlier, Ramzi told CNN she had no idea he'd disappear with their son for nine months, only to be found across the country with 11 other children \"My husband said he was taking Abdul-Ghani to the park, and didn't come back. That was in November 2017. When I would ask him where he was, he said he was on his way, he was coming soon, he was just keeping him for the night. But I haven't seen him since then,\" Ramzi said Tuesday. She said her son cannot walk and suffers seizures, and requires constant medical attention. An arrest warrant states that Wahhaj \"wanted to perform an exorcism\" on the child because he believed he was possessed by the devil. But Ramzi said her husband was planning to perform a ruqya -- an Islamic practice involving prayer that is believed to help rid a body of illness. \"It's not an exorcism. That was a translation issue in the court,\" Ramzi said. He \"just wanted to pray for Abdul-Ghani to get better.\" Police stopped the father in Alabama In December, days after Ramzi reported her son missing, the child's father was involved in an accident in Alabama, according to a police report. The SUV had seven children -- but none of them was listed with Abdul-Ghani's date of\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

Sweden\u2019s murder rate is relatively low in international terms, but gang violence has surged in recent years and Swedes are worried that the police are unable to cope. In 2016, the latest year for which official statistics are available, 106 people were murdered in Sweden, a country of 10 million. But Swedish TV reported there were over 300 shootings, mostly in turf battles between gangs over drugs, protection rackets and prostitution. Four people were shot dead in the first week of this year. One man died after picking up a hand grenade outside a subway station in a suburb of Stockholm. Law and order is likely to be a major issue in a parliamentary election scheduled for September with the populist, opposition Sweden Democrats linking public concern about the rising crime rate to a large increase in the numbers of immigrants. \u201cIt would not be my first option to bring in the military, but I am prepared to do whatever is necessary to make sure that serious, organized crime is stamped out,\u201d Lofven told news agency TT. The government has promised police an extra 7.1 billion crowns ($880 million) through 2020, toughened laws on gun crimes and made it easier for the police to monitor private phone calls and emails, among other measures. But a report by the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention shows increasing numbers of Swedes worried about crime with confidence falling in the police and the judicial system. \u201cPeople are shot to death in pizza restaurants, people are killed by hand grenades they find on the street,\u201d Sweden Democrat leader Jimmie Akesson said in parliament on Wednesday. \u201cThis is the new Sweden; the new, exciting dynamic, multicultural paradise that so many here in this assembly ... have fought to create for so many years,\u201d he said sarcastically.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

'No,' he told NBC in an interview airing Monday on the 'Today' show. 'I do not \u2013 I have never talked to her. But I did say publicly on more than one occasion that I was sorry.' 'I apologized to everybody in the world,' Clinton said, implying that was enough. And the flustered former president, more famous for his Don Juan-like seductions than for his policy legacy, portrayed himself, not Lewinsky, as history's victim in the mass-media's retelling of the 1990s saga. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS Former President Bill Clinton said in an NBC interview airing Monday that he's never personally apologized to Monica Lewinsky for how their sexual affair turned her life upside down \u2013 and he doesn't owe her a mea-culpa The former president carried on a lengthy affair with Lewinsky, often trysting with her just steps from the Oval Office Watch part one of @craigmelvin's interview with Bill Clinton and James Patterson pic.twitter.com/UC8KAQw8Ge \u2014 TODAY (@TODAYshow) June 4, 2018 Her too: Lewinsky has emerged as an anti-bullying activist and now says Clinton engaged in a 'gross abuse of power' by seducing her 'A lot of the facts have been omitted to make the story work,' he declared, 'I think partly because they're frustrated that they got all these serious allegations against the current occupant of the Oval Office and his voters don't seem to care.' And Clinton complained in the interview that he left the presidency financially ruined because of the costs associated with the legal consequences of his actions. 'Nobody believes that I got out of that for free,' he said. 'I left the White House $16 million in debt,' He's worth about $80 million today, aided by an aggressive schedule of speaking events \u2013 many of which paid him six-figure fees for individual appearances. In a March essay for Vanity Fair magazine, Lewinsky wrote that 'what transpired between Bill Clinton and myself was not sexual assault, although we now recognize that it constituted a gross abuse of power.' Clinton is now on a book tour with co-author James Patterson but got pointed questions from NBC in an interview that aired Monday morning Clinton, pictured denying his May-December affair when he was president, was already noted at the time for his lothario habits But decades later, she's still traumatized by the aftermath of being identifed globally as the your woman the President of the United States kept on the side and used for his own pleasure just a few feet from the Oval Office. 'I\u2019m sorry to say I don\u2019t have a definitive answer yet on the meaning of all of the events that led to the 1998 investigation,' Lewinsky wrote of the public humiliation that played out in seeming slow motion. 'I am unpacking and reprocessing what happened to me. Over and over and over again.' Clinton is launching a book tour to promote 'The President is Missing,' a fictional political thriller co-written with the famed author James Patterson. He accused interviewed Craig Melvin of 'ignor[ing] gaping facts in describing this, and I bet you don't know you don't know them.' 'This was litigated 20 years ago. Two-thirds of the American people sided with me.' Lewinsky is pictured on September 21, 1998 meeting with then-president Bill Clinton at a White House function If he were president today, he said later, his most famous extramarital affair wouldn't 'be an issue, because people would be using the facts instead of the imagined facts.' Patterson, too, defended Clinton \u2013 by comparing his sexual affairs in office with those of two preceding Democratic presidents. 'It's 20 years ago, come on!' he blasted Melvin. 'Let's talk about JFK. Let's talk about, you know, LBJ. Stop already!' Clinton piled on. 'You think President Kennedy should have resigned? Do you believe President Johnson should have resigned? Someone should ask you these questions because of the way you formulate the questions,' he jabbed. 'I dealt with it 20 years ago, plus.' Suddenly philosophical and seeming to take a longer view of history, Clinton said: 'I have tried to do a good job since then with my life and with my work. That's all I have to say to you.'\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

Last Friday, President Trump made the following announcement: I have decided not to block release of the CIA\u2019s remaining JFK-assassination related records except for those records that directly implicate the CIA in the assassination, which will continue to remain secret.\u201d Okay, he didn\u2019t really put it like that. But that\u2019s the potential and likely import of his announcement, which actually read as follows: Subject to the receipt of further information, I will be allowing, as President, the long blocked and classified JFK FILES to be opened.\u201d (Italics added.) The operative words, of course, are: \u201cSubject to the receipt of further information\u2026.\u201d What is going on here? Negotiations. The art of the deal. The CIA desperately does not want to show the American people its long-secret JFK-related records. It has asked Trump to continue keeping at least some of them secret notwithstanding the passage of more than 50 years since the Kennedy assassination. Under long-established custom and tradition in Washington, D.C., when someone asks someone else for a favor, the person who is in a position to grant the favor demands something in return. That\u2019s where the negotiations between Trump and the CIA come into play. Trump wants something in return. We don\u2019t know what \u2014 maybe laying off on the Russia investigation \u2014 but his announcement last Friday is obviously part of the concluding steps of such negotiations. Time to buy old US gold coins What Trump has done with his announcement is send a clear message to the CIA: \u201cGive me what I want and I\u2019ll give you want you want. Otherwise, I will let all your cherished long-secret records relating to the JFK assassination be shown to the American people.\u201d Make no mistake about it: A deal is about to be made. The CIA will cave. It will end up giving Trump whatever it is he wants. Trump is in the driver\u2019s seat because the CIA cannot afford to permit the American people to see the records it wants to continue to be kept secret. And once the CIA gives Trump what he wants, he will cave and give the CIA the continued secrecy it so desperately needs. All this will happen by this Thursday, the date set by law for release of all the JFK records that Trump has not blocked. Think about it: The CIA has asked the president to continue secrecy of records that are more than 50 years old or, apparently, some relating to secret correspondence between the CIA and the Assassination Records Review Board back in the 1990s. The CIA\u2019s ground? \u201cNational security\u201d of course, the two most important and meaningless words in the American political lexicon. National security? Really? Whatever definition that one might put on that nebulous term, no reasonable person can honestly believe that the release of 50-year-old records are going to result in the United States falling into the ocean or even that the communists are going to take over the federal government. The CIA says that releasing its decades-old JFK records will reveal secret \u201cmethods\u201d of intelligence gathering. Really? What, like the CIA was using typewriters instead of computers and pay telephones instead of cell phones? What is amazing (or not) is the extreme nonchalance of the mainstream media to the CIA\u2019s request for continued secrecy. That should be big news. It\u2019s essentially an admission of guilt, given that it is absolutely ludicrous to think that \u201cnational security\u201d would be threatened by the release of the CIA\u2019s long-secret JFK-assassination-related records. You see, the mainstream media starts with the assumption that the CIA had nothing to do with the assassination. In their minds, the assassination was committed by a lone nut former U.S. Marine communist, one who had no motive to kill the president. Such being the case, the mainstream media, deferring to the CIA, automatically concludes that its wish to continue keeping secret has to be based on \u201cnational security\u201d grounds rather than an attempt by the CIA to continue its cover-up of its assassination of the president. Let\u2019s proceed from the opposite assumption: That the CIA, in partnership with the military and the Mafia, orchestrated the assassination by framing a former U.S. Marine who was then working for U.S. intelligence, either Navy intelligence, the CIA, or the FBI, or a combination of all three. Don\u2019t forget, after all, that that\u2019s what Oswald said. He said he was being framed. Yet, from the very beginning, the mainstream media has never given any serious consideration to the possibility that Oswald was framed for the crime. Instead, they have steadfastly stuck with the official story, one that has all the characteristics of a pat frame-up: That Oswald acted alone or possibly acted in concert with others, both of which lead to nothing but dead ends, contradictions, and anomalies. Now, let\u2019s assume instead that Oswald was telling the truth when he said he was being framed. In that case, it would be imperative that the CIA and the military keep as tight a lid on their records as possible to ensure that investigators or investigative reporters would have a difficult time piercing through to the circumstantial evidence that establishes the frame-up. As part of the frame-up, the CIA would have to fortify the persona of Oswald, its intelligence agent, as a purported communist. That would enable the CIA to blame the assassination on a communist, which, not coincidentally, was the advice that the Pentagon and the CIA were doling out to Latin American military dictatorships at the School of the Americas. In cases of covert state-sponsored assassinations, Latin American regimes were taught, a good strategy was to blame the assassination on a communist because then they could smear anyone who challenged the official story as a communist sympathizer. It would also explain why the CIA was closely monitoring Oswald\u2019s movements prior to the assassination, something else that the CIA kept secret for decades.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

Thomas Weinandy, the former head of their doctrinal office. It took a matter of hours for the brave defenders of the status quo to leap into action against the mild Franciscan friar\u2019s polite plea to Pope Francis to defend the Catholic Faith and faithful. Or at least to stop attacking them. In a letter made public November 1st, Fr. Weinandy, a former chief of staff for the U.S. Bishops\u2019 Committee on Doctrine and a member of the Vatican\u2019s International Theological Commission, warned Pope Francis that he has caused \u201cchronic confusion\u201d among the faithful and bishops. He wrote to the pope, \u201cTo teach with such an intentional lack of clarity inevitably risks sinning against the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of truth.\u201d He added that Catholics are \u201cdisconcerted\u201d by the appointment of bishops \u201cwho seem not merely open to those who hold views counter to Christian belief, but who support and even defend them.\u201d In an interview yesterday with John Allen\u2019s Crux, he added, more prophetically than he had perhaps intended, \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone can, or should, associate my letter with the USCCB or the American bishops. Neither was involved in my writing the letter, and its publication will be news to them.\u201d \u201cBishops are quick learners,\u201d he wrote in his letter, \u201cand what many have learned from your pontificate is not that you are open to criticism, but that you resent it,\u201d claiming that many bishops don\u2019t speak out publicly for fear they will be \u201cmarginalized or worse.\u201d And sure enough, within hours of making his letter public, we learned that Fr. Weinandy had been given the boot. Of course, the Twitterverse is busy commenting on the irony: how a man expressing grave concerns that there is an atmosphere of fear of being punished for expressing grave concerns, was immediately fired. Perhaps the most astonishing aspect of this little incident is just how completely blind the US bishops \u2013 as with nearly all the episcopate \u2013 are to what political analysts call the \u201coptics\u201d. Political consultants often ask: how does it look? And it looks extremely bad. As though the fog of irony weren\u2019t thick enough, in response to the outrage from Catholics, the USCCB has done what all the other members of Pope Francis\u2019 cabal have done and started blocking critics from its Twitter account. Which, it must be said, only proves Fr. Weinandy\u2019s point once again. Some of the criticism has been unusually sharp. Fr. Hunwicke wrote this afternoon, \u201cThis cheap and vulgar ritual humiliation exemplifies the extent to which P[ope] F[rancis] is presiding over a bully-boy Church in which midget bishops and minicardinals compete to defeat each other in the sycophancy stakes. Just as Tom Weinandy has, in effect, just said.\u201d As I write this, the outrage is doing the opposite of dying down, and is surely a sign of how fed up Catholics \u2013 even those who would never identify themselves as Traditionalists \u2013 have become with this pope and his cadre of episcopal bullies. In his letter, Fr. Weinandy made a point of stating that he is not signatory to the Filial Correction or any other public declaration against Pope Francis\u2019 agenda. In fact, a former student of his wrote to me today saying, \u201cI see that Fr. Thomas Weinandy has been squashed. He was one of my professors in Patristics at Oxford and he was one of the most mild-mannered, least confrontational, kindest academics one could have hoped to meet. To me, the fact that he has chosen to write to express his concern about the crisis in the church and the papacy is very significant. He is neither a traditionalist, nor a controversialist, but a humble and straightforward Friar who is clear-thinking and entirely loyal to the Church and Her teaching. I would be surprised now if we were not see more of this sort of letter/exercise of conscience. I imagine that it\u2019s going to become harder and harder for men of conscience and position to sit on the fence.\u201d When I posted it, this assessment was backed up by Joseph Shaw, the head of the UK\u2019s Latin Mass Society and the spokesman for the Filial Correction, who wrote, \u201cThis is absolutely right. Not a man to seek out confrontation.\u201d The Crux piece offered a succinct bullet point list of Fr. Weinandy\u2019s concerns. He said the pope is\u2026 Fostering \u201cchronic confusion.\u201d \u201cDemeaning\u201d the importance of doctrine. Appointing bishops who \u201cscandalize\u201d believers with dubious \u201cteaching and pastoral practice.\u201d Giving prelates who object the impression they\u2019ll be \u201cmarginalized or worse\u201d if they speak out. Causing faithful Catholics to \u201close confidence in their supreme shepherd.\u201d Our friend Edward Pentin has reproduced the full text of the letter at the National Catholic Register which is definitely worth a read. Fr. Weinandy sent the letter to the pope on July 31, the Feast of St. Ignatius of Loyola. Like the Dubia cardinals, he said he made it public only after the pope had ignored it for months. Notable in his critique is its distinct pastoral flavour, his concern on the effect the situation is having on ordinary people. The pope, he said, seems \u201cto censor and even mock\u201d critics of Amoris Laetitia for their desire to interpret it in keeping with Catholic teaching, and in doing so is committing a \u201ckind of calumny\u2026alien to the nature of the Petrine ministry.\u201d In an interview with Crux, Weinandy said he is not afraid of reprisals but \u201cmore concerned about the good that my letter might do.\u201d The letter \u201cexpresses the concerns of many more people than just me, ordinary people who\u2019ve come to me with their questions and apprehensions. I wanted them to know that I listened.\u201d \u201cI have done what I believe God\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

Al Franken announced his resignationon the Senate floor Thursday morning, as Democratic calls for his resignation mount following the latest sexual misconduct accusations against him. About 30 Senate Democrats, starting with women, have urged the Minnesota Democrat to step down. Franken on Thursday denied most of the allegations, which started to surface last month. Here are the eight accusations he faces: Leeann Tweeden, a radio news anchor, says Franken groped and forcibly kissed her during a USO tour in 2006, before the former comedian was a senator. She says Franken \"aggressively stuck his tongue in my mouth\" when the pair rehearsed a skit that featured a kiss. A photo also surfaced showing Franken looking at a camera while pretending to grab Tweeden's breasts as she was sleeping while clothed. The senator apologized for the photo but said he remembered the skit incident differently. Lindsay Menz says Franken grabbed her buttocks when the pair posed for a photo at the Minnesota State Fair in 2010. Franken later said he did not remember taking the picture but \"felt badly\" that Menz felt disrespected. Two other unidentified women told HuffPost that Franken grabbed their buttocks at separate events in 2007 and 2008. One of the women says Franken suggested that he and she should go to the bathroom together. Franken said he did not remember the events and denied asking anyone to visit the bathroom with him. Stephanie Kemplin, an Army veteran, says Franken put his hand on her breast during a USO tour in 2003. In a statement following that accusation, Franken's office said he has not \"intentionally engage in\" the \"kind of conduct\" described. A woman described as a \"former elected official in New England\" told the Jezebel website that Franken tried to give her a \"wet, open-mouthed kiss\" during an event in 2006. The senator has not appeared to respond specifically to the allegation. An unnamed former Democratic congressional aide told Politico that the senator tried to forcibly kiss her after he taped a radio show in 2006. She says she avoided the kiss, then heard Franken say \"it's my right as an entertainer.\" Franken called the allegation \"categorically not true.\" Tina Dupuy writes in The Atlantic that Franken put his hand around her waist while the pair posed for a photo and squeezed \"at least twice\" during an event in 2009.

            "question": "Which of the following tactics is used in the following text?\n\nArticle: Conspiracy Theorists Seize on Mesa Man Who Sold Ammo to Las Vegas Shooter Thanks to crackpots online, a Mesa man has become embroiled in conspiracy theories after he sold ammunition to the Las Vegas mass shooter. Douglas Haig, a 55-year-old Honeywell engineer, sold more than 700 rounds of ammunition to Las Vegas mass murderer Stephen Paddock in September. Haig's name was inadvertently revealed this week when unredacted court documents were released to reporters. Search warrant records showed that Haig was a person of interest in the investigation of the mass shooting. As a result, Haig said that he has received death threats and people have pounded on his door to tell him that he deserves to die. \"It makes me feel horrible,\" he said at a news conference Friday morning. \"People need to do their research and think rather than just react viscerally.\u201d It's not just people harassing Haig at his home: Conspiracy theorists online have seized on Haig's engineering background to lob wild claims about the Las Vegas shooting. Many of their theories lean heavily on Haig's LinkedIn profile, which says that Haig previously worked for Boeing and Northrop Grumman. Bonkers conspiracy site Intellihub posted an article this week that pointed to Haig's background in the aerospace industry as a sign of U.S. government involvement in the massacre. They noted Haig's LinkedIn page, which says he worked for Boeing in Mesa as a senior liaison engineer in their unmanned helicopter division from 2010 to 2013. \"Let\u2019s not forget that it is a fact that helicopters were lurking behind the Mandalay Bay during the attack which were not shown on the radar,\" author Shepard Ambellas writes. Ambellas claims helicopters provided an \"air assault\" during the massacre, a ludicrous theory he's expounded upon on InfoWars with the internet's conspiracy-theorist-in-chief Alex Jones. Ambellas and Intellihub claim that the FBI and the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department are providing cover for the real story behind the massacre, with help from Haig. In public statements this week, Haig denied any connection to the massacre and said he merely sold Paddock the rounds. \"However, don\u2019t be fooled,\" Intellihub writes. \"Haig is likely a CIA cut-out who is just upholding the public narrative in conjunction with the FBI Las Vegas and the LVMPD.\" Laura Loomer, a noxious far-right personality who formerly worked for Project Veritas, also started making hay with Haig's background in Arizona aerospace. She wrote on Twitter that the massacre \"is starting to look more and more like a gun running operation gone wrong every day.\" Douglas Haig\u2019s @LinkedIn Account says he also has \u201cDOD Top secret clearance\u201d on top of specializing in military ammunition. He is the second suspect in the #LasVegasShooting. This is starting to look more and more like a gun running operation gone wrong every day. pic.twitter.com/ifkkglZ4kw \u2014 Laura Loomer (@LauraLoomer) January 30, 2018 But Haig is an engineer, and he says he's not a former military officer. It should be noted that Haig's rounds were probably not even used in the massacre: Haig sold Paddock tracer ammunition, which emit a flare when fired making them easier to see. Had Paddock fired these rounds during the nighttime massacre at the concert, they would have been visible. Haig's attorney Marc Victor told reporters it was perfectly legal for Haig, a private citizen, to sell Paddock hundreds of rounds of tracer ammunition \u2014 the bullets are legal in Arizona. Paddock showed up to buy ammunition at Haig's home after meeting him at a gun show in Phoenix. \"I sold him 600 rounds of .308 tracer, surplus U.S. military. I sold him 120 rounds of .556 tracer, again, surplus U.S. military,\" Haig said to ABC15. \"I put it in a box for him. He paid me, put it in his car, and left.\" Haig said he's been legally selling ammunition as as a hobby since 1991, but after the massacre, he has stopped his side business. It wasn't unusual for a customer to buy over 700 rounds, he said. \"I've seen all kinds of people. There were no tells,\" Haig said of Paddock. When asked about the threats, Haig said, \u201cI\u2019ve had people screaming they want me to die through my front door.\" Haig and his attorney did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the conspiracy theorizing. Haig said he's sorry that the massacre took place, but emphasized that he had nothing to do with Paddock's mass shooting. \u201cI had no contribution to what Paddock did,\u201d Haig said at the news conference. \u201cI had no way to see into his mind. The product that I sold him had absolutely nothing to do with what he did.\u201d Nevertheless, it's hard to believe that Haig's denials will dissuade the conspiracy-mongers. YouTube conspiracy theorist Jake Morphonios said that for all he knows, Doug Haig didn't play a role in Paddock's massacre. Even so, Morphonious still parlayed an innocent-until-proven-guilty stance into a 30-minute dissertation where he discussed a \"shadow government in the United States\" in the context of Haig's work for companies like Northrop Grumman. \"Did he know something that Stephen Paddock was going to do? That I don't know \u2014 it's possible, but who knows.\" Morphonious said. He added, \"I've got some questions of my own about Doug Haig that I'm going to continue seeking answers for.\"\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

Marx\u2019s idea \u201ctruly seems sacrilegious\u201d and \u201cignores the clear Revelation of God,\u201d Cordes wrote in a response on kath.net. Dr. Maike Hickson translated it at One Peter Five. \u201cThe Church is in its pastoral care bound to Holy Scripture and to its interpretation through the Church\u2019s Magisterium,\u201d wrote Cordes. \u201cMarx does not even mention that homosexuality always contradicts the Will of God,\u201d citing church teaching through the centuries. Rather than being about receiving \u201cGod\u2019s assistance for themselves,\u201d those engaging in sodomy and wishing to have it \u201cblessed\u201d by the Church \u201caim with their request at the recognition and acceptance of their homosexual way of life and its ecclesial valorization.\u201d The Catechism of the Catholic Church teaches that \u201cunder no circumstances\u201d can homosexual activity \u201cbe approved\u201d as it is \u201cintrinsically disordered.\u201d Such acts are \u201ccontrary to the natural law. They close the sexual act to the gift of life. They do not proceed from a genuine affective and sexual complementarity\u201d (CCC 2357). However, Marx said on February 3 that homosexual couples need \u201ccloser pastoral care\u201d and \u201cone must also encourage priests and pastoral workers to give people in concrete situations [of homosexual unions] encouragement. I do not really see any problems there.\u201d Marx is the President of the German Bishops\u2019 Conference. As LifeSiteNews previously reported, Marx also said \u201cyes,\u201d he could imagine the creation of a rite for homosexual couples to be blessed in the Church. This \u201cencouragement\u201d from priests which he called for might include some sort of \u201cliturgical\u201d recognition of their union. But \u201chow this would be done publicly, in a liturgical form,\u201d is \u201canother question...that is where one has to be reticent and also reflect upon that in a good way.\u201d After Catholic News Agency\u2019s initial report on Marx\u2019s comments, his office contacted the outlet and said they had mistranslated part of what he said. The cardinal\u2019s office sent CNA \u201ca request for correction of [its] translation of the interview in question, expressing concern that CNA's translation constitutes a false reference and does not properly reflect the position of Cardinal Marx.\u201d The cardinal\u2019s office maintains that rather than saying \u201cyes,\u201d there is a possibility of liturgical \u201cblessing\u201d of gay unions, he answered the question in a more subtle way without giving an explicit \u201cyes.\u201d However, the German Bishops\u2019 Conference doesn\u2019t seem to deny the rest of his statements on how \u201cone must encourage priests\u201d to give encouragement to homosexual couples, which could include public blessings that would take a \u201cliturgical\u201d form. The cardinal\u2019s staff asked that CNA change his answer about liturgically \u201cblessing\u201d gay unions to: \u201cThere are no general solutions and I think that would not be right, because we are talking about pastoral care for individual cases, and that applies to other areas as well, which we cannot regulate, where we have no sets of rules.\u201d Philadelphia Archbishop Charles Chaput has also spoken out against Marx\u2019s proposal. \u201cAny such \u2018blessing rite\u2019 would cooperate in a morally forbidden act, no matter how sincere the persons seeking the blessing,\u201d wrote Chaput. He explained such a \u201cblessing\u201d would encourage people to continue living in a way the Church considers gravely sinful and spiritually damaging, and therefore would be uncharitable. \u201cThere is no love \u2013 no charity \u2013 without truth, just as there is no real mercy separated from a framework of justice informed and guided by truth,\u201d he wrote. \u201cCreating confusion around important truths of our faith, no matter how positive the intention, only makes a difficult task more difficult.\u201d \u201cThere are two principles we need to remember,\u201d Chaput wrote. \u201cFirst, we need to treat all people with the respect and pastoral concern they deserve as children of God with inherent dignity. This emphatically includes persons with same-sex attraction. Second, there is no truth, no real mercy, and no authentic compassion, in blessing a course of action that leads persons away from God.\u201d \u201cThis in no way is a rejection of the persons seeking such a blessing, but rather a refusal to ignore what we know to be true about the nature of marriage, the family, and the dignity of human sexuality,\u201d he explained. \u201cJesus said the truth will make us free. Nowhere did he suggest it will make us comfortable.\u201d Cordes has a history of defending the Church\u2019s moral teaching. Marx, one of the pope\u2019s nine main advisors, said in 2016 that same-sex relationships have \u201cworth\u201d which must be recognized by the Church.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

            "question": "Which of the following tactics is used in the following text?\n\nArticle: CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta Has Press Pass Restored by White House Jim Acosta has his press pass back. The Trump administration stood down on Monday from its nearly two-week-long dispute with CNN over the White House credentials of Mr. Acosta, informing the correspondent that his badge was formally restored. CNN in turn dropped its lawsuit on the matter, which had ballooned into a test of press freedoms in the Trump era. But while it yielded to Mr. Acosta \u2014 whose testy questions had touched off Mr. Trump\u2019s ire \u2014 the administration used the occasion to lay down a set of formal rules governing reporters\u2019 behavior at future White House news conferences, a highly unusual step. Among the guidelines was a restriction of one question per reporter, with follow-ups allowed at the discretion of the president or the White House official at the lectern. \u201cFailure to abide,\u201d the administration warned, \u201cmay result in suspension or revocation of the journalist\u2019s hard pass.\u201d The White House sought to blame Mr. Acosta for behaving disrespectfully, although Mr. Trump often lobs insults at journalists and encourages a free-for-all format when taking questions from reporters. Codifying the behavior of journalists struck some as an ominous encroachment into freedom of the press, and the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association said on Monday that it had not been consulted about the new guidelines. The American Civil Liberties Union, in a statement, said: \u201cThese rules give the White House far too much discretion to avoid real scrutiny. The White House belongs to the public, not the president, and the job of the press is to ask hard questions, not to be polite company.\u201d Still, the guidelines are not far removed from the manner in which White House news conferences typically proceed. Mr. Trump made clear last week that he would introduce \u201cregulations\u201d after a federal judge criticized the White House for stripping Mr. Acosta\u2019s credentials without due process or a coherent rationale. \u201cWe would have greatly preferred to continue hosting White House press conferences in reliance on a set of understood professional norms, and we believe the overwhelming majority of journalists covering the White House share that preference,\u201d Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the press secretary, said in a statement. Press relations were not always rosy in pre-Trump days. President Barack Obama\u2019s aides preselected the news outlets that were allowed to ask questions at his news conferences. Mr. Obama often chastised reporters, including Mr. Acosta on one occasion, for questions he deemed overly aggressive or grandstanding. But Mr. Trump, a devoted news consumer who relishes his coverage, plays up his conflicts with reporters in part to excite his supporters. He has held far fewer formal news conferences than his predecessors, and the daily White House briefing has virtually disappeared on his watch. Revoking Mr. Acosta\u2019s White House badge was the most severe step yet, and it soon became apparent that the move would not pass legal muster: After suing last week, Mr. Acosta was granted the temporary return of his credentials by a federal judge. A back-and-forth ensued over the weekend. Bill Shine, the deputy chief of staff for communications, sent a letter to Mr. Acosta that listed several reasons that his pass had been revoked, perhaps an attempt to satisfy the judge\u2019s request for a clear rationale. CNN\u2019s lawyers called the note an \u201cafter-the-fact concocted process.\u201d By Monday afternoon, the sides had reached a resolution. Aides to Mr. Trump say that the president does not mind answering questions, pointing to his numerous impromptu sessions with reporters during White House photo-ops and Marine One departures. The aides complain about reporters who they say do not respect the solemnity of the setting, even as Mr. Trump flouts many of the norms associated with his office. \u201cThe White House\u2019s interaction is, and generally should be, subject to a natural give-and-take,\u201d Ms. Sanders wrote on Monday, suggesting that the onus was on the press corps to ensure that a \u201ccode of conduct\u201d did not become necessary. That notion read more like a warning \u2014 behave or else \u2014 and the Correspondents\u2019 Association seemed unmoved. \u201cFor as long as there have been White House press conferences, White House reporters have asked follow-up questions,\u201d the group wrote on Monday. \u201cWe fully expect this tradition will continue.\u201d\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

My brothers, the implication of this today should be the establishment of an Islamic state over all the lands of the Muslims.\u201d take our poll - story continues below Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?

And no call to restore the caliphate would be complete without a swipe at the Jews, whom the Qur\u2019an designates (5:82) the worst enemies of the Muslims. Khecharem predicted that \u201cthis will happen, of course, after the elimination of the filthy Jewish entity, and after liberation of the lands under direct colonization, like Kashmir and others.\u201d If Said Khecharem were a non-Muslim saying that Muslims needed to destroy \u201cthe filthy Jewish entity\u201d and conquer America, Britain, Russia, France, and Italy, he would be accused of \u201cIslamophobia\u201d and \u201cbigotry.\u201d But no one will take any particular notice of this. They should, however. Khecharem is not some deluded fanatic raving on a Tunisian street corner. He was speaking at Hizb ut-Tahrir\u2019s International Caliphate Conference; although Hizb ut-Tahrir is banned in many countries, it still has an international presence, and recently held a conference in Chicago. Nor is the desire to establish a global caliphate limited to Hizb ut-Tahrir alone. The word khalifa means \u201csuccessor\u201d; the caliph in Sunni Islamic theology is the successor of Muhammad as the military, political, and spiritual leader of the Muslims. As I show in my book The History of Jihad From Muhammad to ISIS , the great caliphates of history, from the immediate post-Muhammad period of the \u201cRightly Guided Caliphs\u201d to the Umayyads, Abbasids, and Ottomans, as well as other Islamic states, all waged relentless jihad warfare against non-Muslims, subjugating them under the rule of Islamic law and denying them basic rights. These weren\u2019t the actions of a \u201ctiny minority of extremists,\u201d abhorred by the vast majority of peaceful Muslims for \u201chijacking\u201d their religion. This was, for fourteen centuries, mainstream, normative Islam, carried forth by the primary authorities in the Islamic world at the time. The History of Jihad shows from the accounts of eyewitnesses and contemporary chroniclers through the ages that in every age and in every place where there were Muslims, some of them believed that they had a responsibility given to them by Allah to wage war against and subjugate unbelievers under the rule of Islamic law. And so it is today: Said Khecharem has enunciated that responsibility more clearly and directly than most Muslim spokesmen do these days, but he is by no means the only one who believes that it exists. What is noteworthy also about The History of Jihad is something that it does not contain. As the jihadis move against non-Muslim states without any letup, pause, period of coexistence, period of tolerance, reformation, or reconsideration, there never appears any force of Muslims to oppose them. While it is undoubtedly true that not all Muslims in any given age have ever waged jihad, there has never been in Islamic history an Islamic entity or organization that was opposed to waging jihad and dedicated to stopping those who were waging it. So it is today. Islamic groups in the West issue pro-forma condemnations after every jihad terror attack, but are doing little or nothing to try to prevent the next one. There is still no mosque or Islamic school in the United States that teaches young Muslims why they should reject the understanding of Islam taught by al-Qaeda, ISIS, and other jihad terror groups. Meanwhile, Said Khecharem and other Islamic spokesmen openly call for Muslims to engage in jihad conquest. Western authorities should be pondering his words, and their implications, very carefully. Instead, if they have taken any notice of him at all, which is unlikely, they have dismissed him as an \u201cextremist.\u201d They have yet to come to grips with the fact that \u201cextremism\u201d is and always has been so distressingly widespread in Muslim communities. But they will. Article posted with permission from Robert Spencer\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

The BBC reports that Health Minister Oly Ilunga Kalenga confirmed a case in Mbandaka, a city of a million people about 130km (80 miles) from the area where the first cases were confirmed earlier this month. The city is a major transportation hub with routes to the capital Kinshasa. Forty-four people have been infected and 23 people are known to have died. Senior World Health Organization (WHO) official Peter Salama said the spread to Mbandaka meant there was the potential for an \u201cexplosive increase\u201d in cases. \u201cThis is a major development in the outbreak,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cWe have urban Ebola, which is a very different animal from rural Ebola. The potential for an explosive increase in cases is now there.\u201d Mr Salama, the WHO\u2019s deputy director-general for emergency preparedness and response, said Mbandaka\u2019s location on the Congo river, widely used for transportation, raised the prospect of Ebola spreading to surrounding countries such as Congo-Brazzaville and the Central African Republic as well as downstream to Kinshasa, a city of 10 million people. \u201cThis puts a whole different lens on this outbreak and gives us increased urgency to move very quickly into Mbandaka to stop this new first sign of transmission,\u201d he said. The BBC adds that the WHO said it was not recommending any trade or travel restrictions either within DR Congo, for example between Mbandaka and Kinshasa, or internationally. But Mr Salama said that 13 countries in the region were boosting border screening measures and said DR Congo itself was increasing exit screening measures. \u201cThe good news is that the DR Congo population is very used to Ebola outbreaks,\u201d he added. \u201cThey know to protect themselves by avoiding mass gatherings and mass funerals. They know as well that traditional healers can amplify the outbreak.\u201d As The Daily Mail notes, it is the ninth time Ebola has been recorded in Congo since the disease made its first known appearance near its northern Ebola river in the 1970s. Ebola is most feared for the internal and external bleeding it can cause in victims owing to damage done to blood vessels. The Mail reports that health workers have recorded confirmed, probable and suspected cases of Ebola in three health zones of Congo\u2019s Equateur province, and have identified 432 people who may have had contact with the disease, the WHO said. Supplies sent to Congo included more than 300 body bags for safe burials in affected communities. The vaccine will be reserved for people suspected of coming into contact with the disease, as well as health workers. The vaccine requires storage at a temperature between -60 and -80 degrees C, tricky in a country with unreliable electricity.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

            "question": "Which of the following tactics is used in the following text?\n\nArticle: The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event Daniel Greenfield, a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center, is an investigative journalist and writer focusing on the radical left and Islamic terrorism. The American Jewish Historical Society was founded to study and preserve Jewish history. These days it\u2019s instead partnering with Jewish Voice for Peace: an anti-Israel BDS hate group that defends anti-Semitism and which sponsored talks by an anti-Semite who accused Jews of drinking blood. The fruits of the AJHS and JVP partnership have been a series of events attacking Israel. Coming up in late October is \u201cThe Balfour Declaration: Support for a Jewish Homeland or Jewish State?\u201d The two speakers are Robert Herbst, the coordinator of the Westchester chapter of JVP, and Jonathan Kuttab, who advocates a one-state solution for eliminating Israel. He had tweeted, \"EU no longer considers #Hamas a terrorist group. Time for US to do same.\" Kuttab has defended Islamic anti-Semitism by claiming that the \u201cdistrust Moslems feel towards Jews\u201d is due to \u201ctwo acts of betrayal by Jewish tribes against the Prophet.\u201d And that Jews suffer from a \u201cHolocaust Syndrome\u201d of entitlement. He justified hijacking planes, described suicide bombers as \u201ctaking the supreme sacrifice\u201d and defended Hezbollah as \u201can armed-resistance movement\u201d He has claimed that the \"Jewish community gradually consolidated its power, wealth, and influence in all sectors of society\" especially in \"crucial sectors like banking, finance, media\u201d where \"their influence both as individuals and an organized community far exceeded their numbers\" and that their power strengthens \u201cconspiracy theories about \u2018Jewish control\u2019 that are reminiscent of the infamous \u201c\u2019Protocols of the Elders of Zion.\u2019\u201d Robert Herbst and Jonathan Kuttab are both supporters of a one-state plan for eliminating Israel. The American Jewish Historical Society is co-sponsoring a JVP anti-Israel event by two opponents of Israel, one of whom has defended Hamas. An organization that hands out the Emma Lazarus Award, named after a passionate Zionist, at its posh dinners is hosting attacks on the existence of Israel. The \u201cJewish Homeland\u201d or \u201cJewish State\u201d argument is a hook for contending that the Balfour Declaration didn\u2019t endorse Israel, but some sort of Jewish Bantustan within a Muslim country. That worked so well for the Christians and Jews of the Middle East. The American Jewish Historical Society is not only co-sponsoring a one-state event by an anti-Israel hate group. But it\u2019s also hosting it at the Center for Jewish History\u2019s headquarters. AJHS is a component of the Center for Jewish History. And the partnership between AJHS and JVP sheds light on the controversy over the appointment of David N. Myers, an anti-Israel activist, to head the Center for Jewish History. During the Myers controversy, the Center took pains to disassociate Myers and themselves from JVP because a JVP handout had listed him as a \u201cJVP Academic Advisory Board Member.\u201d But in reality the Center, through AJHS, has an ongoing relationship with JVP. The Balfour event was not AJHS\u2019 only partnership with JVP. In December, the AJHS will feature \u201cRubble Rubble\u201d, a play by Dan Fishback based on his trip to Israel. Fishback is a BDS supporter and a member of the JVP Artists Council. His goal is to \u201cnormalize Jewish anti-Zionism\u201d. AJHS and JVP members get discounted admission. The venue is once again the Center for Jewish History. Specifically the Leo and Julia Forchheimer Auditorium at CJH. Leo Forchheimer\u2019s philanthropy had left its mark on Israel. What would he think if he knew the anti-Israel purposes that CJH is putting his gift to? A third AJHS-JVP event featured Efrat Yerday, an anti-Israel activist, accusing Israel of racism. Efrat has claimed that, \"Zionism does not only dispossess Palestinians, but it also dispossesses in a very sophisticated way, non-white Jews. Being Jewish is highly identified with being white because of Zionism.\" AJHS will claim that it is only offering different perspectives. But when it comes to Israel, there\u2019s only one perspective. \u201cBalfour\u201d and \u201cRubble Rubble\u201d are to be part of AJHS\u2019 \u201c1917: How One Year Changed the World\u201d. The exhibition is supposed to cover WWI, the Bolshevik Revolution, and the Balfour Declaration. But the only Balfour program on the list questions whether Israel should even exist. The exhibition closes with Fishback\u2019s anti-Israel agenda. And these are the only listed AJHS programs that focus on Israel. JVP is also the only organization that AJHS chooses to partner with on political events. The American Jewish Historical Society appears to be uninterested in holding any pro-Israel events. It\u2019s uninterested in partnering with pro-Israel groups. Instead it\u2019s providing a forum for a BDS hate group. And it\u2019s no mystery why. The AJHS Academic Council is packed with anti-Israel activists. Lila Corwin-Berman, the chair of the AJHS Academic Council who also serves on its board of trustees, is a member of the Open Hillel Academic Council. Open Hillel seeks to \"open\" the campus group to BDS and other anti-Israel views. Berman has defended the anti-Israel hate group IfNotNow, which employs JVP tactics, and condemned efforts to fight BDS. She signed a petition in support of BDS activists being allowed to enter Israel. Other AJHS Academic Council members who signed the pro-BDS activist petition include Ari Kelman, Riv-Ellen Prell, Deborah Dash Moore, Rachel Kranson, Libby Garland and Kirsten Fermaglich. When we look at what is going on in CJH\u2019s components like the AJHS, the elevation of David N. Myers to head CJH is unsurprising. Myers is a symptom of the problem. As is AJHS\u2019s partnership with JVP. A great deal of shocking behavior is taking place inside Jewish organizations whose inner workings most people in the Jewish community generally pay very little attention to. Unlike CJH, the American Jewish Historical Society is an organization that dates back to the 19th century. Its perversion by the radical anti-Jewish and anti-Israel left to serve anti-Semitic narratives is tragic. And yet it\u2019s inescapable. Even as the Myers scandal continues to simmer, the AJHS partnership with JVP\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

The Democrats are committing voter fraud on a massive scale, and not only in Florida, but in Arizona, Georgia, California and elsewhere. In Arizona, it is already over, and a pro-jihad Marxist Democrat who lost the election will be going to the Senate. In Florida, the Democrats are likewise working feverishly to overturn the will of the people.

The concerns, which the department says can be tied to the Florida Democratic Party, center around date changes on forms used to fix vote-by-mail ballots sent with incorrect or missing information. Known as \u201ccure affidavits,\u201d those documents used to fix mail ballots were due no later than 5 p.m. on Nov. 5 \u2014 the day before the election. But affidavits released on Tuesday by the DOS show that documents from four different counties said the ballots could be returned by 5 p.m. on Thursday, which is not accurate. Audio of a Florida Democratic Party caller leaving a voicemail message asking a Palm Beach County voter to fix their vote by mail ballot after Election Day, which is not allowed, was also sent to POLITICO separately. It was not part of the information turned over to federal prosecutors. Among the counties in question is Broward, which emerged as the epicenter of controversy as three statewide races and three local legislative races went into recounts following the Nov. 6 elections. Republicans have pointed to embattled Broward Elections chief Brenda Snipes\u2019 record of past election gaffes in arguing that the largely Democratic country is tilted against them \u2014 perhaps fraudulently so. DOS officials have repeatedly told the media that the monitors they sent to Broward County saw no election fraud. It wasn\u2019t until Tuesday that the office revealed publicly that it had turned over information to federal prosecutors. The information was sent on Nov. 9 by Bradley McVay, DOS\u2019 interim general counsel, who asked that the altered dates be investigated. \u201cAltering a form in a manner that provides the incorrect date for a voter to cure a defect \u2026 imposes a burden on the voter significant enough to frustrate the voter\u2019s ability to vote,\u201d McVay wrote in a letter that was sent Nov. 9 and released publicly on Tuesday. The letter was sent to U.S. Attorneys Christopher P. Canova of the Northern District of Florida, Maria Chapa Lopez of the Middle District of Florida and Ariana Fajardo Orshan in the Southern District of Florida. The records released by DOS, which is part of Gov. Rick Scott\u2019s administration, point the finger at the Florida Democratic Party. Political parties can get daily lists of people who had their mail-in ballots rejected. Political parties \u2014 or anyone else \u2014 can also get the publicly available cure affidavits and send them to voters who had a mail-in ballot rejected to encourage them to fix the ballots. In an email chain released as part of the Department of State\u2019s Tuesday document dump, Citrus County Supervisor of Elections Susan Gill last week told DOS officials that a voter who received one of the cure affidavits with the wrong date had also received a call from a number identified as the Tallahassee office of the Florida Democratic Party, an indication the party was reaching out about her vote by mail ballot. \u201cWhen I called it, it is the Democratic Party of Florida,\u201d she said in a Nov. 8 email to DOS officials. She went on to write that she thinks the incorrect date was used because whoever sent the cure affidavit mixed up the deadline for cure affidavits with the deadline for provisional ballots. But, she said, \u201ca bigger problem is the fact they actually changed one of the DOE forms.\u201d\u2026\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

The audio recordings, taken from the night of the October 1st massacre that left 58 dead and over 500 injured, are further proof that multiple shooters were used throughout the area, a fact that directly contradicts the official story. During the air traffic control recordings, which were released by political strategist and co-founder of \u201cThe New Right\u201d Mike Tokes, one of the dispatchers is heard telling an incoming plane that landing might not be a good idea because there were multiple active shooters on the airport property itself. \u201cShutting down might not be a good idea, there\u2019s active shooters on the runway,\u201d he declared. \u201cThe 19s are closed, we are in the process of trying to round them up, they are on the airport property.\u201d Air traffic control tapes on the night of the Las Vegas shooting: \u201cThere\u2019s active shooters on the runway.

While there have been countless stories since the attack that raise the very real possibility that this was a false flag, one has stood out due to the fact that the person who released the information died shortly after. As Shepard Ambellas reported in a now viral article, \u201cKymberley Suchomel, who posted her eyewitness account of the Las Vegas massacre in astonishingly vivid detail to her Facebook page on Oct. 4, subsequently passed away in her home on Oct. 9 from what reports are claiming are natural causes.\u201d \u201cShockingly, just days before her death, Suchomel posted key details about the shooting to Facebook that contradicted the official narrative which claims that Stephen Paddock was the lone gunman.\u201d From dozens of eyewitness reports, including Suchomel\u2019s, that clearly indicate the presence of multiple shooters, to the possibility of helicopters being used in the attack, the American people are clearly not being told the truth. It is also important to keep in mind that multiple investigative reports conducted by other alternative media outlets have actually named government officials and private companies that may be behind the attack and so far there has been no official denial from either.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

One would think these people would understand that this is not a First Amendment issue. If it were, they wouldn't have to apply for a White House press pass.

However, the cable news channel is showing more and more that it is not fair and balanced and is far from what conservatives think it is as it blasted the White House about not giving little Jimmy his press pass back. In a statement by Fox News President Jay Wallace, he wrote: \u201cFox News supports CNN in its legal effort to regain its White House reporter\u2019s press credential. We intend to file an amicus brief with the U.S. District Court. Secret Service passes for working White House journalists should never be weaponized. While we don\u2019t condone the growing antagonistic tone by both the president and the press at recent media avails, we do support a free press, access and open exchanges for the American people.\" So, file it! On the basis of what, Mr. Wallace? The free press still exists, and you know what? Jim Acosta and CNN continue to lie, just like they have for decades, and here's the proof. Look how they doctored the video to not show what clearly took place and then lied about it, and I suppose Fox falls right in line with that behavior. So, Fox joins with the least trusted name in news, the Clown News Network, to go after the White House on something that is the White House's prerogative and claim it's about free press. It's not. Fox reported: The White House Correspondents\u2019 Association \u2013 of which Fox News is a member \u2013 issued a statement in support of CNN\u2019s decision to take legal action. \u201cWe continue to urge the administration to reverse course and fully reinstate CNN\u2019s correspondent,\u201d WHCA President Olivier Knox said. \u201cThe President of the United States should not be in the business of arbitrarily picking the men and women who cover him.\u201d However, several prominent media members \u2013 such as Pulitzer Prize-winning Watergate journalist Bob Woodward \u2013 have criticized CNN over the lawsuit. As they should. It's frivolous, but because they are immature children over at CNN, it's not surprising, and frankly, it's no surprise coming from Fox either. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders called the CNN lawsuit \"grandstanding.\" I wonder what she will call the amicus brief from Fox. \"This is just more grandstanding from CNN, and we will vigorously defend against this lawsuit,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cCNN, who has nearly 50 additional hard pass holders, and Mr. Acosta is no more or less special than any other media outlet or reporter with respect to the First Amendment. After Mr. Acosta asked the President two questions \u2014 each of which the President answered \u2014 he physically refused to surrender a White House microphone to an intern, so that other reporters might ask their questions. This was not the first time this reporter has inappropriately refused to yield to other reporters.\u201d Of course, CNN was thrilled as Fox more than likely helped them grow a little in ratings by issuing support.

And the interstellar object will continue to spin for billions of years as it journeys through space, scientists have reported in a study published in Nature Astronomy. This is the latest of several revelations following the first-ever discovery of a solar system invader last October. Initially believed to be a comet, then an asteroid, scientists think the wandering \u201cinterstellar object\u201d is a hunk of ice wrapped in organic sun-blocking material. M Kornmesser/ESO/Flickr \"At some point or another it's been in a collision,\" Queen's University, Belfast, research fellow and lecturer Wes Fraser told the BBC. The research team watched 'Oumuamua\u2019s brightness change over time to model exactly how it was spinning. 'Oumuamua \u201cappears to be in an excited rotational state undergoing non-principal axis rotation\u201d the study authors wrote. This unusual \u201cexcited\u201d movement is better known as \u201ctumbling.\u201d \u201cTumbling is an unusual state of rotation,\u201d Fraser said during Sunday\u2019s episode of the BBC\u2019s long-running Sky at Night show. \u201cIt quickly starts to wobble around chaotically.\u201d See all of the best photos of the week in these slideshows The icy cigar was probably knocked askew by a violent collision with another object. The researchers don\u2019t know exactly when this happened, but suspect it took place before 'Oumuamua left its home stellar system. \"It's hard to know if it was during planet formation or after the planet formation process,\" Fraser said during the show. \"Certainly, more collisions happen while planets are growing than afterwards, so that\u2019s a very good guess. But unfortunately we can\u2019t get a high-resolution image of this thing to see what kind of crater is on it that might be attributed to the collision that caused it to start tumbling.\" The team think 'Oumuamua may eventually move less chaotically. \"The tumbling actually causes stresses and strains internal to the object, and that slowly but surely squeezes and pulls on the object just like tides on the Earth to remove energy from the spin,\" Fraser said. But, at least for the next few billion years, the space invader is destined to continue its topsy-turvy spin.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

However, that should not be good enough for the people of Broward County nor the state of Florida. Charges must be made and her arrest should be imminent. The Sun-Sentinel reports: Just hours after finishing a tumultuous election recount, Broward Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes submitted her resignation, ending a 15-year tenure full of botched elections, legal disputes and blistering criticism. take our poll - story continues below Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?

She did send it,\u201d said Burnadette Norris-Weeks, an attorney who works as counsel to the Supervisor of Elections Office. Evelyn Perez-Verdia, a former office spokeswoman who left several years ago, said Sunday evening she was told by people in the office that the letter was sent \u201cto Tallahassee\u201d earlier in the day. Norris-Weeks said she saw an early draft of the letter. In the version she saw, she said Snipes, 75, expressed a desire to spend more time with her family. In the final version of the resignation letter, sent to Gov. Rick Scott, Snipes said it was her \u201cpassion and honor\u201d to have served in the office. \u201cI am ready to pass the torch,\u201d she wrote in the letter, which made no mention of controversies surrounding the 2018 election. By the way, she missed her deadline. \u201cAlthough I have enjoyed this work tremendously over these many election cycles, both large and small, I am ready to pass the torch,\u201d she wrote. She should be ready for prison bars after the fiasco she has created. Snipes allowed illegal aliens, non-citizens and felons to vote. According to Breitbart, she illegally destroyed ballots. Three statewide races in Florida are headed to a recount and all depend on results from a county whose supervisor of elections has a history of losing ballots and breaking laws by allowing illegal immigrants and felons to vote, as well as illegally destroying ballots. Broward County supervisor of elections Brenda Snipes\u2019 office has admitted \u201cthey don\u2019t know\u201d how many ballots there are still to count. Snipes\u2019 latest failure to finalize Tuesday\u2019s election returns days after the polls closed is also in violation of Florida law, which requires elections officials to \u201creport all early voting and all tabulated vote-by-mail results to the Department of State within 30 minutes after the polls close. Thereafter, the canvassing board shall report, with the exception of provisional ballot results, updated precinct election results to the department at least every 45 minutes until all results are completely reported.\u201d The irony that a constitutionally ineligible candidate for the presidency and RINO extraordinaire, Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL), pointed out that voter fraud going on in Florida just a day after the elections probably didn't help the pressure that Snipes was facing. No evidence of fraud in #FloridaElection? Dems got voters to use altered forms to fix & submit as many mail ballots as possible after FL deadline in hopes that a judge would later order state to count them. Today that\u2019s exactly what a federal judge did. https://t.co/MC4Tlvy9gi \u2014 Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) November 15, 2018 Naples Daily News: A day after Florida\u2019s election left top state races too close to call, a Democratic party leader directed staffers and volunteers to share altered election forms with voters to fix signature problems on absentee ballots after the state\u2019s deadline. The altered forms surfaced in Broward, Santa Rosa, Citrus and Okaloosa counties and were reported to federal prosecutors to review for possible election fraud as Florida counties completed a required recount in three top races. But an email obtained by the USA TODAY NETWORK \u2013 Florida shows that Florida Democrats were organizing a broader statewide effort beyond those counties to give voters the altered forms to fix improper absentee ballots after the Nov. 5 deadline. Democratic party leaders provided staffers with copies of a form, known as a \u201ccure affidavit,\u201d that had been modified to include an inaccurate Nov. 8 deadline. We also know that a Broward County employee, Chelsey Smith, signed an affidavit affirming that she had seen members of Snipes' staff engaging in voter fraud. She ignored a court order, mixed invalid provisional ballots in with valid ones, and destroyed ballots, but don't worry, a Democrat attorney says that doing so has nothing to do with fraud or corruption. Now that federal prosecutors have gotten involved, perhaps it's time to quit talking about it and actually arrest this woman and charge her with crimes against the people of Broward County before more people end up dead in Broward County over their corrupt voting practices.

Almost no national media outlet has covered the story. CNN only mentioned it when it embedded Jake Tapper's tweets about the support for Farrakhan by Women's March leaders. But Rep. Danny Davis had defended Farrakhan. Democratic Illinois Rep. Danny Davis defended Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan as an \u201coutstanding human being\u201d on Monday. Farrakhan\u2019s history of racially extreme comments includes blaming Jews for the September 11 attacks, saying white people \u201cdeserve to die\u201d and praising Adolf Hitler as a \u201cvery great man.\u201d \u201cI personally know [Farrakhan], I\u2019ve been to his home, done meetings, participated in events with him,\u201d Davis told TheDC. The JTA's awkward attempt to whitewash the newly revealed CBC anti-Semitism included a claim from the ADL that Rep. Davis had been misquoted. An ADL official told JTA on Friday that the group had reached out to Rep. Danny Davis, a Democrat, after an article in The Daily Caller said he lauded Farrakhan on Monday as \u201can outstanding human being.\u201d Farrakhan has calledJews \u201cthe enemy of God and the enemy of the righteous,\u201d and said Jews were responsible for the 9/11 terror attacks and the rise of the Ku Klux Klan in the 20th century. \u201cThe congressman was insistent that The Daily Caller misquoted him during the interview and that he didn\u2019t subscribe to Farrakhan\u2019s anti-Semitic statements and actions in the past,\u201d the ADL official told JTA in a statement. \u201cHe expressed an interest in seeing some of the latest statements made by Farrakhan vis-a-vis Jews, which we promptly shared with him.\u201d The official said the ADL had shared information with Davis about Farrakhan\u2019s anti-Semitic statements, and that the organization was waiting to hear back from him. Now, Rep. Davis would really like to emphasize that the ADL is wrong and he loves Farrakhan. Democratic Illinois Rep. Danny Davis confirmed in an interview Sunday that he has a personal relationship with Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, a notorious anti-Semite, and said he isn\u2019t bothered by Farrakhan\u2019s position on \u201cthe Jewish question.\u201d Farrakhan has repeatedly denounced Jews as \u201csatanic,\u201d praised Hitler as a \u201cvery great man\u201d and has said that white people \u201cdeserve to die.\u201d The congressman wasn\u2019t sure why the ADL wrote that he had been misquoted in his praise for the anti-Semite, and said he wasn\u2019t sure if someone from his office had told the ADL he was misquoted, he told The Daily Caller News Foundation on Sunday. \u201cI think that was what they wanted to write. Nah, I don\u2019t have no problems with Farrakhan, I don\u2019t spend a whole lot of my time dealing with those kind of things,\u201d Davis said. \u201cThat\u2019s just one segment of what goes on in our world. The world is so much bigger than Farrakhan and the Jewish question and his position on that and so forth. For those heavy into it, that\u2019s their thing, but it ain\u2019t my thing,\u201d he said The people who talk about the \"Jewish question\" are generally anti-Semites. Somehow I don't think a white congressman would get away with saying that he agrees with David Duke on the environment but isn't especially concerned about his racism. But black leaders have gotten away with playing that game with Farrakhan repeatedly. But the ADL and the JTA will whitewash this again. And if they can't whitewash this, they'll ignore it.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

For Trump, that amounted to a triumphant outcome in his extraordinary gamble with the rogue kingdom's despotic leader. But there were scant details on what new commitments had been secured from Kim, even as Trump announced he would end the regular military exercises the US conducts with South Korea. Whether nuclear disarmament is indeed the final outcome of Tuesday's summit won't be known for years, if not decades. But the dramatic act of extending his hand to one of America's longtime adversaries will forever illustrate Trump's gut-driven, norm-shattering tenure. \"We both want to do something. We both are going to do something. And we have developed a very special bond,\" Trump said at the conclusion of the landmark summit. \"People are going to be very impressed. People are going to be very happy.\" The document he and Kim signed said the North Korean leader \"reaffirmed his firm and unwavering commitment to complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\" In exchange, Trump agreed to \"provide security guarantees\" to North Korea. But there was no mentioning the previous US aim of \"complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization.\" And Kim's commitments did not appear to go beyond what he already pledged to do in April when he met South Korean President Moon Jae-in along their countries' border. Trump insisted during a news conference the agreement went further than many people expected. But he acknowledged the effort to rid North Korea of its nuclear arsenal was in its early stages. \"We will do it as fast as it can mechanically and physically be done,\" he said. More critical, in Trump's telling, was the development of a personal bond with Kim, a brutal dictator responsible for the deaths not only of his own citizens but of at least one American, Otto Warmbier, who was returned to the US in a coma only to die days later. \"I think our whole relationship with North Korea and the Korean Peninsula is going to be a very much different situation than it has in the past,\" Trump said during the summit. Later, during his news conference, Trump said Warmbier's death contributed to the summit taking place. \"Without Otto, this would not have happened,\" Trump said. Trump and Kim -- both intent on making history -- greeted each other early in the day with extended hands in front of a row of US and North Korean flags, a previously unthinkable sight that reflects a new chapter in the two countries' acrimonious relationship. Trump's threats to politely walk out of the meeting if his expectations were unmet did not materialize. Instead he predicted he could \"solve a big problem, a big dilemma\" alongside his new partner. \"Working together, we'll get it taken care of,\" Trump said. The remarks came amid an improbable series of events that few could have anticipated even three months ago. The unlikely images of US and North Korean counterparts engaging in friendly dialogue lent the day an air of unreality. In a detailed menu, the White House said the men were served H\u00e4agen-Dazs vanilla ice cream for dessert. Other unforeseen events also surrounded the summit, increasing the drama. Minutes before the historic handshake, Trump tweeted that his top economic adviser Larry Kudlow had suffered a heart attack. Immediately after the encounter, Dennis Rodman -- one of the only Americans to have met Kim -- was openly weeping while being interviewed by CNN's Chris Cuomo. Even Kim seemed to acknowledge the surreality of the day. \"Many people in the world will think of this as a (inaudible) form of fantasy ... from a science fiction movie,\" his translator was overheard saying as the two leaders walked down a white-columned colonnade. At the conclusion of the summit, Trump hailed the talks as a historic, and personal, achievement. \"We learned a lot about each other and our countries,\" Trump said. \"I learned he's a very talented man.\" When pressed about those comments in light of Kim's brutal tactics, Trump continued praising the North Korean leaders' ability to run a country at a young age. \"He is very talented,\" Trump said, citing Kim's ability to \"take over a situation like he did at 26 years of age and run it, and run it tough.\" Kim assumed power after his father Kim Jong Il, also a brutal dictator, died in 2011. Throughout the day, Trump and Kim's body language was openly friendly, a striking warmth given Kim's iron grip on power and dismal record on human rights. Trump's move to meet him attracted fierce criticism for normalizing a regime routinely called out for its human rights abuses, that over years has built an image of fearsome renegade regime, throwing around threats of nuclear war. The day began with Trump patting Kim on the back and placing his hand on the North Korean's shoulder as they walked into their first meeting. Later they were seen smiling and laughing over lunch. Trump told reporters he would \"absolutely\" extend an invitation to the White House to Kim, who also heralded a new era. \"Today, we had a historic meeting and decided to leave the past behind,\" Kim said through a translator. \"The world will see a major change.\" The meeting came only months after the two men traded nuclear taunts, ratcheting up tensions and leading to fears of war. By contrast, Trump appeared to back off a military footing on Tuesday, declaring the US will stop the \"war games,\" an apparent reference to joint military exercises with South Korea that North Korea has long rebuked as provocative. Trump also said he hopes to eventually withdraw US forces from South Korea, but said \"that's not part of the equation right\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

            "question": "Which of the following tactics is used in the following text?\n\nArticle: Ammo seller to Las Vegas killer arrested on federal charge (CNN) Douglas Haig, an Arizona man who says he sold tracer ammunition to the gunman in October's Las Vegas massacre, was arrested Friday on a charge of conspiring to manufacture and sell another type of ammunition -- armor-piercing bullets -- in violation of federal law. A criminal complaint alleges two unfired .308-caliber (7.62mm) rounds found in gunman Stephen Paddock's hotel room had Haig's fingerprints on them as well as tool marks from his workshop. The bullets in the cartridges were armor-piercing, with an incendiary capsule in the nose, the complaint says. The FBI on October 19 searched Haig's Mesa home and seized ammunition the agency says is armor-piercing, the complaint said. Haig did not have a license to manufacture armor-piercing ammunition, documents said. Police say Paddock, 64, opened fire on October 1 from his 32nd-floor room at Las Vegas' Mandalay Bay hotel onto a crowd attending a music festival, killing 58 people and shooting and injuring 422 others. More than 850 others suffered other injuries in the attack. Investigators say Paddock died of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. Douglas Haig's name was revealed in the release of search warrant records. Haig, 55, appeared in court Friday and was released on his own recognizance with specific conditions not spelled out in court proceedings. He is due in court again February 15 for a preliminary hearing. The maximum penalty for manufacturing illegal ammunition is five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. Haig's attorney, Marc J. Victor, told CNN he had no comment. CNN affiliate KNXV caught up with Victor outside court, and the lawyer said he couldn't say anything because of the ongoing case. \"My first obligation and only obligation is to my client,\" he told KNXV. The complaint Haig was publicly linked to the Las Vegas investigation Tuesday when a judge unsealed months-old police search warrant records that named him as a person of interest In a Friday morning news conference before his arrest, Haig, responding to the documents' release, said he sold tracer ammunition to Paddock at his home in September after they met at a gun show. Tracer ammunition has a pyrotechnic charge that, when fired, leaves an illuminated trace that can help a shooter have a more precise idea of where the bullet is going. Haig did not describe the ammunition as armor-piercing. Victor, at the same news conference at his Phoenix-area office, said the tracer ammunition that Haig sold Paddock \"was not modified in any way ... from manufacturer's specs.\" But in Friday's criminal complaint, investigators say Haig and an associate also claimed they sold to Paddock other ammunition -- four or five 10-round packages of .308-caliber incendiary ammunition -- at a Las Vegas gun show in August. It's not clear from the complaint whether the two armor-piercing rounds with the incendiary capsule are from the packages Haig allegedly told investigators he sold Paddock at the gun show. The complaint also does not say whether Paddock fired any of the ammunition that he bought from Haig.

We decided long ago that the dangers of excessive and unwarranted concealment of pertinent facts far outweighed the dangers which are cited to justify it. Even today, there is little value in opposing the threat of a closed society by imitating its arbitrary restrictions. Even today, there is little value in insuring the survival of our nation if our traditions do not survive with it. And there is very grave danger that an announced need for increased security will be seized upon by those anxious to expand its meaning to the very limits of official censorship and concealment. \u2013 JFK If you haven\u2019t already heard, Facebook has completely shut down hundreds, if not thousands of Independent media pages over the last year. Some of the biggest pages include The Free Thought Project and The Anti-media, with millions of followers each, and years of sourced journalism. These pages, among others, became targets a long time ago. Working directly in the field and behind the scenes, I can tell you that all of us have been aware of the censorship initiative for a long time because it started approximately three years ago now. The complete deletion of multiple pages kicked off by popular media figure Alex Jones, was followed by a massive campaign of \u201cfake news\u201d awareness. One thing we need to remember here is, this isn\u2019t about democrats vs republicans, it\u2019s about the elite preserving their control, and at the moment, they are using the DNC as the mouthpiece for that. Thus, anything that slandered Hillary Clinton during the presidential campaign, for example, was labelled as fake news, even if evidence and credible sources were used. This is because she is part of that elite. This is cyber false flagging at its finest, where authority figures at Facebook and within government agencies decide for the people what is real, and what is not, These tactics are complemented by a large mainstream media campaign that created awareness about fake news. Monkey see, monkey do. With Liberty and Justi... Glenn Greenwald Best Price: $2.66 Buy New $11.34 (as of 02:05 EST - Details) Many believed what media and social media did during that election, and still now, and take on the opinion that people cannot just say what they want on the internet. This has some validity, but ultimately, the fact that Facebook pages with credibility were deleted makes it quite clear what\u2019s going on here. These pages presented declassified documents, information about corporations and mainstream media, real whistleblower testimony and more. Yet still, they were deleted. The population should be able to examine a source of information and determine for themselves if it\u2019s credible, not have an authority figure do it for them. We don\u2019t need fact checkers, we ourselves should be those fact checkers! We have a responsibility to our planet to be those fact checkers, and not let authority figures with a tremendous amount of power, wealth, and conflicts of interests do it for us. \u201cThe problem of fake news isn\u2019t solved by hoping for a referee, but rather because we as citizens, we as users of these services, help each other. We talk and we share and we point out what is fake. We point out what is true. The answer to bad speech is not censorship, the answer to bad speech is more speech. We have to exercise and spread the idea that critical thinking matters, now more than ever, given the fact that lies seem to be getting more popular.\u201d \u2013Edward Snowden (source) Facebook A Revolving Door Facebook has become a revolving door like Monsanto, with high-ranking DARPA employees, like Regina Duggan, who has since left Facebook, and people from similar backgrounds now spearheading their mission. What is Facebook\u2019s mission? Well at the moment it seems to be censoring of information. Their key strategy is to label everything as fake news to build an excuse to delete Facebook pages that are dissenting voices. You see, independent media, like CE, became extremely popular, receiving many millions in website every single month, that traffic came from Facebook. Independent media outlets were greatly surpassing mainstream media in their power and voice. This is something people on the outside can\u2019t really see as all of this happens, but I am on the inside, so I see exactly what\u2019s taking place. Eyes were shifting away from the small group of people who have controlled media since media\u2019s inception. Independent media brought to light a number of facts that threaten the agenda of the global elite, like intelligence agency/government connections to mainstream media for example, and their plans in the middle east to basically invade, take-over, and establish a government that suits the Deep State\u2019s best interests. There are several examples from all fields that surround human life, from healthcare to politics, and it all seems to be controlled by one massive conglomerate at the top. We\u2019ve been writing about this for nearly a decade now. The Deep State Has Power Due To Our Unconsciousness They (global elite) continue to do what they are able to do because of human consciousness. The more people who consider this a \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d and turn their heads away, the easier it is for them to continue and have power. I don\u2019t understand how so much information can come to light, yet when it\u2019s deemed a \u201cconspiracy\u201d theory\u201d within mainstream media, everybody simply follows the rhetoric, without doing any investigation or research for themselves. If you don\u2019t look into it, don\u2019t share an opinion on it. \u201cCondemnation without investigation is the height of ignorance.\u201d \u2013 Einstein.

The vaccination campaign will begin today. \u201cThe vaccination campaign begins tomorrow, Monday, in Mbandaka, capital of the province,\u201d Minister of Health Oly Ilunga told The Associated Press as reported by 9 News Australia. \u201cIt will target, first, the health staff, the contacts of the sick and the contacts of the contacts.\u201d The World Health Organization has been warning about the \u201cEbola situation\u201d in Congo, and it appears their only solution is an experimental vaccine. An experimental vaccine is one that has never been tried on humans before. Ebola hemorrhagic fever, seen mostly only in Africa, is one of the world\u2019s most feared diseases. It begins with flu-like symptoms, followed by bloody diarrhea and vomiting. Days later, some victims begin bleeding through the nose, mouth, and eyes. Depending on the strain of the Ebola virus, it can kill up to 90% of victims. There is no cure for Ebola. The virus is spread through direct contact with the blood or secretions of an infected person. So, is the Ebola virus reaching a terrifying enough level that an experimental vaccine is warranted? The death toll has reached 26 and the vaccine will be rolled out at Mbandaka, the north-western city of 1.2 million recently struck by the outbreak. Since the virus is spread through direct contact, an isn\u2019t airborne, it isn\u2019t nearly as deadly as it could be. Read more here about Ebola and how it is transmitted: Initially, the campaign will target 600 people, mainly medical staff, contacts of suspected cases, and those who have been in contact with the contacts, Ilunga said. Officials are working urgently to prevent the disease from spreading beyond Mbandaka, which lies on the Congo River, a busy traffic corridor, and is an hour\u2019s flight from the capital. The spread of Ebola from a rural area to Mbandaka has raised alarm as Ebola can spread more quickly in urban centers. The fever can cause severe internal bleeding that is often fatal. Meaning, the virus itself doesn\u2019t actually kill. The immune system\u2019s response to the virus is what\u2019s deadly. ZMapp is also an experimental drug that could aid in the recovery from the Ebola virus. But, like the vaccine being administered, it has not been tested for safety or efficacy yet. It is not a vaccine \u2013 it is a therapeutic drug. Of the seven people given the drug so far, two have died. ZMapp show \u201cpromise,\u201d although scientific results are not definitive. The risk of Ebola spreading within Congo is \u201cvery high,\u201d according to authorities, and the disease could also move into nine neighboring countries, the World Health Organization has warned. The WHO, however, stopped short of declaring the outbreak a global health emergency. WHO said there should not be restrictions on international travel or trade. In the meantime, it\u2019s important to prevent oneself from contracting the virus. Unfortunately, health care workers are at the greatest risk as they try to cull the suffering: which is why they will be the first to get the experimental vaccine. For their sake, let\u2019s hope it works better than this year\u2019s flu vaccine.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

Douglas Haig New documents reveal the name of the second person of interest in the Las Vegas shooting. Police believe Douglas Haig may have conspired with gunman Stephen Paddock, but it's unclear if he's still under investigation. Haig sold Paddock ammunition the month before the October attack that killed 58 people dead and wounded hundreds of others. Mandalay Bay hotel staff had numerous run-ins with Vegas gunman: companyLas Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock had lost money, been depressed, sheriff says Haig was contacted one day after the attack, after investigators found an Amazon box with his address on it inside Paddock's hotel room, reports CBS News correspondent Mireya Villarreal. But Haig says he had no idea what Paddock was planning to do when he met him just a few weeks before the massacre. Haig says he sold Paddock 720 rounds of ammunition from Haig's home gun business. \"I couldn't detect anything wrong with this guy,\" he said. \"He told me exactly what he wanted. I handed him a box with the ammunition in it, and he paid me and he left.\" The rounds he sold are called \"tracer ammunition\" \u2013 bullets that leave a visible trail when fired. \"He said he was going to go put on a light show. And I can't remember whether he said for or with his friends, but that's what he did say,\" Haig said. But newly released search warrant records filed last fall by the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department say Haig \"may have conspired with Stephen Paddock to commit murder with a deadly weapon.\" Haig strongly denies that. \"I felt that they were hoping that they could find a connection between myself and Paddock, that would go back showing that I supplied him with most of his ammunition, possibly even some firearms,\" Haig said. \"They're not gonna find it. I talked to the guy three times.\" It's unclear whether Haig is still a person of interest, but he was the only one mentioned by name in the search warrant, other than Marilou Danley - Paddock's girlfriend. Authorities have since said they don't plan to bring charges against Danley. Las Vegas gunman's motive still unknown Haig does not blame himself, but within weeks of the massacre, he still decided to shut down his business. \"I'm still racking my brain for what did I miss. Why didn't I pick this up?\" he said. Haig, represented by his Phoenix attorneys Marc Victor and Andrew Marcantel, has not been charged. His attorneys say he continues to cooperate with investigators. CBS News reached out to the FBI and other authorities involved, but none will comment on an active investigation.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

The twelfth-century Muslim historian Ibn Baydhaq detailed how the Almohads treated the Jews as they advanced: Abd al-Mumin\u2026the leader of the Almohads after the death of Muhammad ibn Tumart the Mahdi\u2026captured Tlemcen [in the Maghreb] and killed all those who were in it, including the Jews, except those who embraced Islam\u2026. [In Sijilmasa] one hundred and fifty persons were killed for clinging to their [Jewish] faith\u2026. All the cities in the Almoravid state were conquered by the Almohads. One hundred thousand persons were killed in Fez on that occasion, and 120,000 in Marrakesh. The Jews in all [Maghreb] localities [conquered]\u2026groaned under the heavy yoke of the Almohads; many had been killed, many others converted; none were able to appear in public as Jews.

What size of bakery would you need to make 10,000 loaves of bread?\u2026 What if you wanted to make 50,000 loaves of bread an hour? You would need a larger bakery.

We used to think that fashion has to do with haircuts, clothes, or lifestyle, but the vogue today is to sympathize with the Jews and to shed crocodile tears about their sorrows, their heresy, and their historical lies. This is, indeed, a new fashion. Some esteemed people shed tears about what the Jews call \u2018the Holocaust.\u2019 [\u2026] \u201cDid the Nazi annihilation \u2013 the Holocaust \u2013 target only the Jews? Anybody? The Jews claim that it happened to them alone and that the number of Jews who died in that Holocaust was six million. What we have here are historical errors. First of all, the figure of six million is a historical lie. In addition, claiming that it happened to the Jews alone excludes the non-Jews who were tortured by Hitler. So was it annihilation? Yes, it was. Who did Hitler annihilate? He annihilated a group of races and people, some of whom were even German. Hitler annihilated 400,000 Germans who were handicapped or suffered from chronic diseases. Hitler did not annihilate the Jews only. [\u2026] \u201cHitler was not the first in the West to perpetrate a genocide. Inhuman and criminal annihilation runs in the veins of many in the West. Hitler embodies one type of modern Western annihilation. When the Americans occupied the republics of the Indians, they annihilated millions of human beings. It is said that they annihilated 50-100 hundred million, but nobody ever mentions this. [\u2026] \u201cWas there annihilation? Yes. Many races were annihilated. The Auschwitz camp, which is in southern Poland, was a major and exceptional camp for detention, torture, and forced labor. Many people were tortured and were starved to death there. [\u2026] \u201cThe Jews were banished, tortured, and annihilated because of their deeds. They were not banished for being Jews. There were Jews in the Islamic countries and caliphates as well, but we never killed them just for being Jews. No, it never happened. Hitler and the Nazi state knew the truth about the Jews, and therefore, they began tormenting and persecuting them. [\u2026] \u201cThat is when the Final Solution began. The Nazis called it the \u2018Final Solution\u2019 of the Jews. When we say \u2018Final Solution,\u2019 we realize that many of the terms used by the Zionist state constitute Nazi terms, ideas, and notions. It is as if they are two faces of the same coin.

However, it is now being reported that an FBI informant that was involved in the Uranium One deal, has told congressional committees that Moscow paid lobbyists to influence then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by helping former President Bill Clinton\u2019s charities during the Obama administration. The Hill's John Solomon reported on Wednesday: The informant, Douglas Campbell, said in the statement obtained by The Hill that he was told by Russian nuclear executives that Moscow had hired the American lobbying firm APCO Worldwide specifically because it was in position to influence the Obama administration, and more specifically Hillary Clinton. ... Campbell added in the testimony that Russian nuclear officials \u201ctold me at various times that they expected APCO to apply a portion of the $3 million annual lobbying fee it was receiving from the Russians to provide in-kind support for the Clintons' Global Initiative.\" \u201cThe contract called for four payments of $750,000 over twelve months. APCO was expected to give assistance free of charge to the Clinton Global Initiative as part of their effort to create a favorable environment to ensure the Obama administration made affirmative decisions on everything from Uranium One to the U.S.-Russia Civilian Nuclear Cooperation agreement.\" APCO officials told The Hill that its support for the Clinton Global Initiative and its work with Russia were not connected in any way, and in fact involved different divisions of the firm. They added their lobbying for Russia did not involve Uranium One but rather focused on regulatory issues aimed at helping Russia better compete for nuclear fuel contracts inside the United States. In case you are unfamiliar with Uranium One, it is a Canadian mining company whose sale to a Russian firm was approved in 2010. The sale gave the Russians control of part of the US uranium supply, thus why I reference a case could be made for treason. While Democrats have unsurprisingly questioned Campbell's credibility, Campbell's attorney Victoria Toensing told Sean Hannity, \u201c[The Russians] were so confident that they told Mr. Campbell with the Clinton\u2019s help, it was a shoo-in to get CFIUS [The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States] approval. They were so confident in that that they even had him open up the new office because they were planning on the kind of business they were going to do as soon as CFIUS approved it.\u201d In a lengthy report by Award-winning National Security/War Correspondent Sara Carter, she pointed out that following: On Wednesday, he shared with the committee information he provided to the FBI and has in the past described his frustration with the Obama administration\u2019s failure to stop Russia\u2019s nuclear giant from purchasing 20 percent of American uranium mining assets. Campbell testified before numerous Congressional investigators that his extensive counterintelligence work on Russia and stated that during his time as an informant, he obtained information that Russia was continuing to aid the Iranian government. According to Campbell Russia provided the resources necessary for the nation\u2019s nuclear reactors, despite promises that they were not sharing such technology with Iran. In an April 16, 2010, summary brief provided to his former FBI handlers and obtained by this reporter, he stressed his deep concerns about Tenex, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Russian state nuclear arm Rosatom and its ongoing work to provide Iran with the technology needed for its nuclear reactor program. At the time, Rosatom was seeking the approval to purchase the Canadian mining company Uranium One. \u201cTENEX continues to supply Iran with fuel through their Russian company TVEL,\u201d stated Campbell in a 2010 brief provided to the FBI. TVEL is a Russian nuclear fuel cycle company headquartered in Moscow. \u201cThey (TVEL) continue to assist with construction consult and fabricated assemblies to supply the reactor. Fabricated assemblies require sophisticated engineering and are arranged inside the reactor with the help and consult of TVEL.\u201d Campbell informed the FBI of the close relationship between TVEL and TENEX, both a part of the Rosatom group. He stated in his brief that while spending time with the Russian executives from both Rosatom and Tenex, that any mention of \u201cTVEL is a subject that is serious to all when mentioned. I do not even raise the subject of TVEL to our friends, but occasionally they speak of it and always in a guarded manner.\u201d In the briefs, he informed the FBI that \u201coccasionally someone will mention having been in Iran but usually it is long after the fact.\u201d And when he asked the Russians about these connections, he stated that they \u201coccasionally speak of the relationship, i.e. equipment, consulting. I asked Vadim (Mikerin) if they felt there was a serious problem, and would they adhere to sanctions and western opinion. His response was a smile and shoulder shrug.\u201d But Campbell had provided the FBI with evidence of the criminal network and delivered the information to the FBI, which was monitoring his work as an informant and approving his transfer of bribery money to the Russians. Those transfers, which were made in bulk $50,000 sums and at times delivered in cash, occurred between senior executives of the American transportation company and the Russian executives connected to Rosatom. He had given the FBI irrefutable evidence showing how contracts obtained from the same Russian energy company Tenex, were based on contract bribery and other nefarious actions, he said. Senior members of the FBI, Department of Treasury, Department of Energy and Department of Justice were also briefed on Campbell\u2019s information and were apprised of the various facets pertaining to Russia\u2019s acquisition of the Canadian\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",

SPONSORED Rombot, part of a wave of Indonesian Christians who fled their country following deadly riots in 1998, learned of the policy change when he appeared for an Aug. 1 check-in with ICE and was arrested. \u201cHe walks out of the courthouse right now,\u201d Chief U.S. District Judge Patti Saris said after concluding that Rombot\u2019s detention violated his rights. He walked out of the U.S. District Court in Boston in his blue jail scrubs, without a chance to change into street clothes. Rombot\u2019s lawyers said he was arrested despite a 2015 letter from ICE saying he would have a chance to prepare for an \u201corderly\u201d departure. The judge cited that letter during Wednesday\u2019s hearing in holding that Rombot\u2019s detention despite ICE\u2019s previous guidance violated his due process rights under the U.S. Constitution. \u201cThis is what intent was, that he would be given the opportunity to leave under his own steam and not under shackles,\u201d she said. Outside the courtroom, Rombot said: \u201cI just want to say thank you to my attorney, my pastor and all of my friends.\u201d The U.S. Attorney\u2019s office is considering an appeal, a spokeswoman said. ICE officials said the arrangement had always been a temporary one and that the agency always had discretion to deport the people covered by the arrangement. The Indonesians are part of an ethnic community of about 2,000 people clustered around the city of Dover in New Hampshire\u2019s seacoast region. Members of the group and advocates say they fear they could face discrimination or violence if forced to return to the world\u2019s largest Muslim-majority country. Their cause has drawn the support of Republican Governor Chris Sununu and New Hampshire\u2019s all-Democratic congressional delegation, including U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen.

Last week, the Florida Department of State asked federal prosecutors to look into alterations made on official election documents from the 2018 midterms. Politico reported that the department points to the Florida Democratic Party for changing dates on forms used to amend absentee and mail-in ballots. These ballots would have been flagged for missing information or for being filled out with incorrect information. The amending forms, called \u201ccure affidavits,\u201d were due at 5 p.m on Nov. 5, the evening before Election Day, at the latest. During pre-Election Day absentee and mail-in voting, political parties have access to lists of people whose mail-in ballots were rejected for errors. Meanwhile, cure affidavits are publicly available and anyone can send them to voters to prompt them to \u201cfix\u201d their ballots. According to Politico, the DOS released affidavits on Tuesday, which demonstrate that four different counties said the ballots could be returned by 5 p.m on Thursday, Nov. 8, past the official due date. Among the counties involved with the altered affidavits is Broward, which has been a hotspot for controversy as many Florida races have led to a recount. Some people point to Brenda Snipes, Broward\u2019s Elections chief, for her troubling history of election transgressions. Do you agree with the call for a federal investigation? Yes No Completing this poll entitles you to Conservative Tribune news updates free of charge. You may opt out at anytime. You also agree to our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use. Politico reported that they received audio of a Florida Democratic party volunteer leaving a voicemail to a voter in Palm Beach County to revise their mailed ballot after Election Day. Palm Beach County failed to make Florida\u2019s recount deadline on Thursday. Matt Dixon, bureau chief of Politico, tweeted on Wednesday that the Democratic party volunteer call came during Florida\u2019s ballot recount after ballots were allowed to be amended. \u201cWe are now doing a recount, so we want to make sure you let your vote be counted,\u201d Dixon quoted from the voicemail. It seems that Democrats may have called absentee voters about supplying them with cure affidavits after the permitted date. It also looks like whoever sent out the cure affidavits physically changed the due date to say Nov. 8, instead of Nov. 6. Bradley McVay, DOS interim general counsel, asked attorneys in Florida to investigate the conflicting dates. \u201cAltering a form in a manner that provides the incorrect date for a voter to cure a defect \u2026 imposes a burden on the voter significant enough to frustrate the voter\u2019s ability to vote,\u201d McVay wrote in a letter, sent on Nov. 9 and publicly released on Tuesday. According to DOS officials, they are less concerned with the inaccurate dates, and more concerned with the fact that the cure affidavits appear to have been deliberately altered. State officials turned over the altered forms to federal investigators. Of the many allegations of ballot mishandling in Florida, this is the first that has been referred to the federal government. While Democrats seem to have told voters they could fix ballot errors up to the Thursday after Election Day \u2014 these votes could not count. It looks like Democrats may have hurt their own interests by misleading their voters. They may have believed that they were supplying the correct information, but they still should not have altered official documents without verifying that they were right, which they weren\u2019t. It is yet to be determined whether the federal investigation will find Democratic ineptitude or deception in this case.\nPlease select the correct answer from A, B, C, D.",
